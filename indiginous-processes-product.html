        <h5 align="left">PROCESSES AND PRODUCT IN RURAL  ARCHITECTURE - 
          A Southern African Case Study</h5>
        <p align="left">Franco Frescura</p>
        <h5>INTRODUCTION</h5>
        <p>The role played by social process in the production of a built  environment is a factor seldom recognised in the modern practice of  architecture. Since the sixteenth century, when architects began to sever their  links to the guilds, the task of design has moved increasingly into the hands  of a small group of specialists. While this shift relieved them, in many ways,  of straight-jacketed tradition, it also decreased their accountability to the  wider community. In time specialist designers developed a public image which  portrayed them as idiosyncratic, artistically potent, patriarchal, Renaissance  figures, having an intuitive grasp of all factors aesthetic and all matters  practical. By implication this meant that they implemented a top-down approach  to design which slowly marginalised the consumer group and effectively excluded  all but the very rich, or the very poor, from the process of construction.</p>
        <p>This alienation was aggravated after the 1920s, when many of the  world's regional architectures, traditionally endowed with a well-defined  taxonomy of forms and textures, began to be eroded by a modernist and  internationalist philosophy which eschews such idioms. The result has been the  loss of not only many local and folk architectures, but also the traditions and  social processes which gave rise to them. Unfortunately, whilst modernism  sought to destroy the elements of the old order, it did little to create new  symbols. The result was an architecture elitist in nature, and devoid of  popular identity. The task of rectifying matters was left to historians,  archaeologists and anthropologists whose work since the 1970s has done much to  reverse the modernist trend. As a result, increasing emphasis has been laid, in  recent times, upon understanding the built environment as the product of social  processes.</p>
        <p>Today, we have begun to understand that the buildings of any given  society cannot be studied in isolation of their socio-economic context.  Designers are therefore having to learn new skills in order to service a  clientele whose demands for greater accountability and a share in the  decision-making process are aimed at overcoming the imbalance created by their  exclusion from technical production. This has become most particularly relevant  in the case of societies whose socio-political realities forefront issues of  economic development and basic shelter over questions of fashion, style and  aesthetics.</p>
        <p>It is in this context that the architecture of rural and  traditionalist communities have many lessons to offer to the modern architect.  Here the cooperative roles of consumer and producer in the creation of a built  environment have remained relatively well defined, and many of the textures and  forms which typify their buildings are seen to be the outcome of cooperation  between kinship, gender and age groups. This paper focuses upon the social and  material interactions of such communities in the production of shelter, and suggests  that such lessons may find practical application for designers working in the  contexts of both developing and developed economies.</p>
        <h5>PROCESS  AND PRODUCT</h5>
        <p>The word &quot;<em>process</em>&quot; describes the physical means  employed to achieve a particular goal as well as the historical, social and  economic circumstances surrounding such an event; &quot;<em>product</em>&quot;  therefore becomes that ultimate goal. Thus, to pick the simple example of an  artist's work, students of &quot;process&quot; would consider such  factors as social background, economic standing, psychological make-up and the  nature of the rendered subject matter; students of &quot;product&quot;,  on the other hand, might limit their studies to the artist's final output, the  aesthetic and compositional properties of the pictorial rendition.</p>
        <p>It is wrong, however, for analysis to isolate process from  product, favouring one ahead of the other, for the two must be seen as parts of  an interacting and interdependent whole. The textures and texts derived during  process are an integral part of the aesthetics of product, and the skilled  builder, crafter or artist often is able to employ these deliberately to give  their work added dimension.</p>
        <h5>ARCHITECTURAL  STEREOTYPES</h5>
        <p>An important element in the creation of an architecture is also  the idea of &quot;stereotype&quot;, particularly when this is applied to  the buildings of a region or a culture. A stereotype, or a style as it might  also be called, centers upon the forms, textures and decorative motifs of the  built habitat. It is the gestalt image of all of these factors. It might, in  some instances, also reflect a particular use of space, but this is usually  cognitive to the resident and hidden to the casual visitor. Therefore any  changes to the visual or aesthetic stereotype of a built environment are  usually the manifestation of wider and deep-seated changes in the physical  context, economic activities and technological culture of the builders  themselves.</p>
        <p>The Basotho, of Lesotho  and the northern OFS, are an interesting case in point. As a group they could  not be said to boast of a collective national and thus cultural identity prior  to 1835 (Lye and Murray 1980). The writings of Casalis (1833), Widdicombe  (1895) and James Walton (1956) reveal that they underwent at least three major  changes of domestic architectural stereotype less than 150 years. These, in  their own time and in their own turn, were all described by outside observers  as &quot;baSotho dwellings&quot; leading to the creation of a concurrent  &quot;Sotho style&quot; or stereotype (illustration 1). Under these  circumstances, the concept of such a group or &quot;cultural&quot;  stereotype must be questioned, not only because in this particular case it may  be proved that its form changed three times in the brief period of seven  generations, but also because stylistic changes as the result of physical and  material fluctuations often precede those made thorough conscious aesthetic and  cultural choices. In the debate between function and aesthetics, process  generally precedes product. By extension, then, the concept of a regional  architecture based upon pragmatic considerations of materials available and  prevailing physical environment precedes the development or emergence of an  architectural stereotype linked to the idea of a regional or cultural identity.  This is not to deny the possibility that architectural stereotypes may exist as  part of a group's cultural awareness; it is merely to state that such  stereotypes are not constants and that they too are subject to change or  manipulation from one generation to the next.</p>
        <h5>THE  ARCHITECTURE OF PRAGMATISM</h5>
        <p>The provision of indigenous shelter in southern Africa  has largely been a pragmatic and highly functional process. For a number of  historical reasons, the region's rural economy never entered an industrial  stage and although settlements of ten to twenty thousand persons were not  uncommon (Holub 1881), these areas never achieved a high degree of urbanization  as it is conventionally understood by western society. In fact mobility of  domicile has always been a desirable quality of rural settlement for economic  (Burchell 1822) and mystical (Schapera 1930), as well as political reasons  (Peires 1981). Thus although certain sites are known to have been inhabited  over a period of many centuries (Fouche 1937), the southern African rural  dweller does not appear to have shared his European counterpart's preoccupation  with permanence (illustration 2). In fact the formers&rsquo; whole concept of land  ownership and tenure differed radically from the European example, being based  upon a system of common ownership under the stewardship of a traditional tribal  head (Davenport and Hunt 1974).</p>
        <p>Because of these factors, rural architecture has depended directly  upon the availability of local building materials for its existence. It is true  that at least one group, the Khoikhoi, are known to have made use of  dismountable and highly portable dwellings (illustration 3) (Kolbe 1727). It is  also true that certain Nguni groups are known to have transported their  dwellings, ready-made, over relatively short distances (Kuper 1963). However  the former are a distinct exception to the general rule for the region, while  the latter are not reputed to have transplanted themselves in this manner with  frequency or over any great distance. Thus the assumption that rural  architecture derives its existence from the availability of found and natural  materials in the immediate vicinity of a settlement must be held to be the  rule, rather than the exception. The rural builder uses the natural environment  as a ready quarry, obtaining the sticks, the stones, the clay and the grass  required from the surrounding countryside.</p>
        <p>It is therefore a highly functional kind of architecture which  uses materials according to their natural properties. This, to a large extent,  also has the result of affecting not only the resolution of some details of  construction, such as the treatment of the roof apex and the connection between  wall and roof at the eaves, but also, by implication, the dwelling form itself,  giving rise to the beginnings of an architectural style which, with time, may  become incorporated into a larger concept of cultural stereotype. The cone on  cylinder, for example, is a dwelling form found universally throughout southern  Africa, and although its basic structure  remains essentially the same, its details differ markedly from region to  region. In the Transkei  the eaves overhang is kept small; the apex is poorly resolved with clay  packing; the finial has no symbolic or long-term structural significance; and  outside functional spaces are loosely defined (illustration 4). In Venda, on the  other hand, roof eaves are kept wide; the apex is well resolved in grass  thatch; the finial enjoys structural and symbolic status; and outside living  areas are tightly defined by a series of sculpted walls, steps, seats and textured  floors (illustration 5).</p>
        <p>Field work conducted in southern Africa  between 1976 and 1985 has shown that the images projected by stereotypes among  rural people themselves, were based upon aesthetic factors in a dwelling form  rather than upon the nature of its structure. This meant that the textures  derived through the use of different building materials, or the use of the same  material, such as grass, but according to different techniques, contributed as  much to the regional identity of the dwelling as did its overall form. On the  other hand it was also found that although rural communities generally had an  awareness of technological processes involved in the construction of dwellings  in neighbouring regions, these were not perceived to be differences so much as  variations upon the same theme.</p>
        <p>The relationship existing between materials, environment and  dwelling form is perhaps nowhere better illustrated than in the squatter camps  located in the vicinity of some of southern Africa's  major urban centres. During the course of a previous study, which included  settlements in the western Cape, the Durban-Pietermaritzburg area, Thaba 'Nchu  in the OFS and the Winterveld district near Pretoria (Frescura 1982), it was  found that congested living conditions increased competition for basic building  resources and gave rise to a uniform style of squatter architecture.  Interestingly, it was noted that although the building technologies used were  an adaptation of the region's rural know-how, in many cases the builders were  not newly migrated rural workers but rather second and third generation urban  residents who had not as yet been catered for in official housing programmes  (Haarhoff 1982). This data has been supported by subsequent research in the eastern Cape (Frescura  1987). This has shown that an absence of natural building materials forced  squatters of both local urban and immigrant rural origins to turn to the  consumer society about them, using its cast-offs as a new form of found  materials (illustration 6). Despite obvious differences in their socio-economic  backgrounds, both groups had come to the same pragmatic conclusions regarding  their habitat and shared in a common dwelling form built out of a common  technology based upon local conditions. The degree of inventiveness shown by  both communities in the taking of common objects out of their familiar context  and adapting them to fulfill new functions successfully demonstrated a shared  ability to grasp the fundamental nature and properties of materials when faced with  the economic realities of their situation.</p>
        <h5>THE  ECOLOGY OF THE RURAL DWELLING</h5>
        <p>Whilst the aesthetics of rural architecture are undoubtedly part  of its charms, they are also an outward manifestation of yet another important  aspect of the rural habitat: the fact that the dwelling is part of a delicate  environmental balance, both at the level of an individual unit and at the  larger scale of regional settlement.</p>
        <p>In the past it was common for rural residents to build fires  inside their dwellings for both heating and cooking functions. Quite often this  was first done outside and it was only a small brazier of hot coals which was  finally brought indoors. The smoke from these fires was allowed to rise and  percolate through the thatch roof thus effectively fumigating it and  discouraging vermin infestation. To a certain extent this process must also be  assumed to have been effective where clay walls were concerned. However, higher  settlement densities brought about increased competition for roof thatching  resources leading many owners to change their roof covering and replace the  grass with zinc sheeting (Frescura 1981). As a result it became impossible to  build an effective fire within a dwelling without the assistance of a smoke  flue. As in the majority of cases the flue has not found popular application in  the region's architecture, most persons have ceased to build internal fires  thus terminating the fumigation process of their dwellings. One probable result  of this action has been the introduction of cement into rural construction in  order to reduce or eliminate infestation. Once a family can afford to use  cement in its walls, it is likely to cut down on its maintenance efforts by  also using this material in the floor. However cement floors are hard and cold  to sleep on and therefore European-style furniture will be bought to replace  the traditional mats, thus also implying a transition from a local subsistence  and craft-manufacturing economy to an externally based cash-using society.  However modern furniture joinery is normally based upon a 90&deg;  geometry which makes a circular floor plan difficult to furnish. This therefore  might bring about a change in the floor plan from the circular to the square,  forcing amendments in the roof technology. This process of breakdown need not  necessarily begin with fumigation. Often the purchase of furniture has proved  sufficient stimulus to bring about changes in both the dwelling's floor plan  and its building technology. In other recorded cases the cycle was broken when  the family, tired of the constant maintenance required by a clay floor,  replaced it with cement.</p>
        <h5>THE  ECOLOGY OF RURAL SETTLEMENT</h5>
        <p>The ecological balance achieved between the settlement of rural  man and nature is somewhat more complex, being influenced by such factors as  social custom, land ownership rights and traditional agrarian practices. This  paper ignores most of these issues and concentrates only upon those elements  which bear directly upon the development of infrastructural support to  settlement.</p>
        <p>All settlement, be it rural or urban, tends to generate a certain  amount of wastes, partly natural, partly manufactured, which are absorbed and  processed during a natural cycle of birth, life and death. In rural areas the  midden plays an important role in incorporating some of these wastes into the  rural cycle of life with farm animals consuming food scraps and rolling in the  spent hearth ashes as a means of controlling ticks. Others wastes are allowed  to decompose organically and are simply absorbed into the soil.</p>
        <p>In more recent times we have seen the rise in southern Africa of  large scale rural, semi-urban settlements in such places as Acornhoek,  Bushbuckridge, Melelane, Thaba 'Nchu, Mabopane and Dennilton, to name but a  few. These towns are endowed with few social amenities and virtually no  supporting physical infrastructure. In such areas many of the historical  concepts of &quot;homestead&quot; have fallen by the wayside and the  control of land for agricultural purposes has been overtaken by the need for  residential space. Also the competition for building resources has forced rural  builders into using modified rural technologies in order to provide themselves  with housing of an acceptable standard. Despite the lack of fresh water and  waste removal facilities they have generally met with a remarkably high degree  of success. However in some areas population densities have reached such  concentrations that natural processes have not been able to keep up with the  inflow of waste materials, resulting in pollution of water resources. The  outbreaks of cholera experienced in the central and western Transvaal  during the summer of 1981-1982 must be attributed directly to the overburdening  of rural land by human settlements living in near-urban densities but under  rural conditions (Frescura 1983).</p>
        <h5>A  COMMUNITY OF BUILDERS</h5>
        <p>The concept of a vernacular architecture must also be seen to be  closely linked to the social processes of rural society. It was found, during  the course of current field work, that the construction of a dwelling was considered  to be something more than must the provision of shelter; in many ways it acted  as an opportunity for the community to collaborate together on a project,  turning what was outwardly a social occasion into a display of solidarity  between the larger group and the individual family. Not only did this tend to  reinforce rural man's sense of identity but, more importantly in architectural  terms, it brought the construction and aesthetics of the individual dwelling  into line with the community's norms.</p>
        <p>The symbolism of this act is important.&nbsp; In traditional rural society a great deal of  emphasis was, and still is, placed upon role playing and task fulfillment. This  creates a strong awareness in individuals of their role in society and their  personal contribution to its survival as a production unit. Anti-social  behaviour is quickly identified and corrected and peer group pressure plays an  important role in suppressing deviancy from the group's norms. This contrasts  sharply with modern western urban society where a sense of identity is often  associated with deviancy from its norms and, in some instances, is promoted and  even applauded. In a sense therefore southern African rural society may be seen  as encouraging self-identity through participation in group activities  (illustration 7) and, unlike western society where originality of style in  domestic architecture is seen as a desirable statement of self, the former uses  group participation as a means of ensuring norm conformance by its individual  members.</p>
        <p>In this respect therefore, the differences between urban and rural  inhabitants may be seen to centre upon the individual perceptions of their own  basic economic and social units. The lowest common social denominator in  western urban society is the nuclear monogamous family whose members may  participate in the economic activities of the larger community, but generally  need not exercise a direct control upon resources or the processes of  production in order to ensure their economic survival. The southern African rural  social unit, on the other hand, is the extended and potentially polygamous  family which traditionally has depended upon its continued control of both  natural resources and independent means of production in order to secure its  own well-being. The first has currently developed a tendency to emphasise the  residence of the individual family and has come to expect that its progeny will  move off, often before marriage takes place, to establish core groups of their  own. This process of fission therefore tends to stress the survival of an  individual as a potentially independent economic unit able to exist apart from  the larger family group. The southern African rural community, by contrast,  stresses the habitat of the larger group as a whole within which individual  members are given residence in commensuration with their age, sex and status  (illustration 8). Fission within the group can and often does take place for  social and economic reasons, but individuals are not expected to leave before  marriage and, in many cases, are encouraged to remain with their spouses within  their parent settlement after it has taken place. Where schisms do occur within  the larger community, the split is seldom permanent, and symbolic, social and  physical links are often maintained between the parts. The retention of such  links should in itself be seen to be part of a mechanism for reinforcing the  status of individuals (and their families) within the larger social structure,  links which emphasise the place of persons within the group as well as the  roles of economic collaboration and interdependence existing between the two.</p>
        <p>The participation of the group in the provision of shelter for the  individual family also gives us a valuable insight into the attitudes and  values of rural residents. By elevating building to the level of a group  activity, the rural dweller places it alongside other communal functions such  as harvesting and defence, thus, in a sense, recognizing its importance as an  element of rural survival.</p>
        <p>Rural construction must also be seen in the context of the  processes of interaction existing between male and female, young and old in  rural society. All members of the community are considered to have a role to  play in the building of a dwelling: in some groups the young may weave grass  ropes under the guidance of their elders whilst listening to folk tales and  singing memory-training songs in the evenings prior to the day of building; the  women will be out collecting thatching grass and later will build and plaster  the clay walls (illustration 9); the men will seek out the best building  timbers, make the roof and thatch it. It must be stated that, although it was  found during the course of current research that the division of labour between  male and female must, at one time, have been strongly defined, more recently  this distinction has tended to disappear, due largely to the prolonged absence  of the men, away in the urban areas as migrant workers. This has, in many  cases, forced the women into fulfilling some of the tasks of the men in the  provision of shelter for their families. Moreover, it has been found that the  traditional division of building tasks between men and women is not always  constant from region to region. For example one group may assign the task of  thatching to women while another may reserve the construction of the entire  roof to the men.</p>
        <h5>PRODUCER  vs CONSUMER</h5>
        <p>Perhaps one of the more relevant lessons which rural architecture  can offer to modern man lies in the economics of its production. At a time when  many countries in the developing world are beginning to look to self-help  methods as a means of resolving their local housing problems, the architecture  of rural man is offering the dynamics which may make such programmes viable.  Among the first to point this out was Amos Rapoport who, writing in 1969  (Rapoport 1969), saw vernacular as the link existing between what he termed  &quot;primitive&quot; and &quot;high style&quot; architectures.  Rapoport's model uses socio-economic terms of reference to describe the  processes of architecture at various levels of activity. By applying Rapoport's  guidelines it becomes possible to divide the vernacular architecture of the  region into five, not separate but interlinked, stages.</p>
        <ol type="a">
          <li>Hunter-gatherer  society.</li>
          <li>Migrant  pastoralist society.</li>
          <li>Early  agricultural pastoralist society.</li>
          <li>Late  agricultural society.</li>
          <li>Early  urbanizing society.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>In Rapoport's terms it may be said that in all of the above stages  building was, and in many cases still is, being conducted by the community as  one of its everyday activities, much like hoeing the fields and cooking a meal  (Krige and Krige 1943). Its performance involves the community as a whole, most  of who have knowledge and personal experience of the processes involved. In all  cases the building forms used are part of a larger vocabulary of architecture  common to the community as a whole.</p>
        <p>However changes are noticeable in the final two stages which see  the emergence of a class of specialist craftsmen who offer their services in  exchange for a fee, usually paid in money. This takes place without necessarily  precluding any of the other factors. The consumer remains knowledgeable in the  building process and most often is active within it. For the first time,  however, a degree of alienation emerges between consumers and producers. The  former begin to employ craftsmen for either reasons of skill or of time; the  latter have developed special skills which they are able to market profitably.  The building form also changes. The historically preferred circular plan is  supplanted by the square or the rectangle, a process which also involves a  compromise in structure, and hence technology, in order to achieve a dwelling  which conforms to the prevailing local architectural style. This process is  reinforced by greater conglomerations of settlement which force the rural  dweller to turn to new building materials and hence technologies and, in many  cases, new dwelling forms.</p>
        <p>In a larger sense Rapoport's analysis is concerned with the  relationship existing in the building process between producer and consumer. In  a rural economy the two roles are generally incorporated in the same person.  The client more often than not is also the builder, and has an intimate  knowledge of the building process and is aware of the type, style and form of  the structure which is being built. In advanced urban economies virtually all  building activity is in the hands of specialist craftsmen, a factor enforced in  some cases by legislation; clients have no hand in and usually no knowledge of  the building process; and unless wealthy enough to be able to employ the  services of a specialist designer, they will have only the most superficial of  choices in the aesthetics of their dwellings. Often the structure will be  purchased already completed, much like an appliance in a retail store.</p>
        <h5>CONCLUSIONS</h5>
        <p>Rural architecture may, in many ways, be seen to short-cut the  relationship established in modern urban society between consumer and producer.  Because it uses locally available materials in a most economical way,  incorporating them into a highly functional structure, and employs the cheapest  labour possible, that of the client, it must be seen to offer the solutions to  at least some of the problems which beset the current provision of housing in  the developing world. Its value lies not so much in its ability to provide  shelter so much as in the social processes that such habitat represents,  processes which offer the community an element of choice and a degree of  democratic participation in the provision of their own housing. The control of  resources and of means of production is an important element in the political  and economic empowerment of communities whose sole options often are not  between a pretty house and an ugly house, but between having a house and having  no house at all.</p>
