          THABA BOSIGO, also spelt THABA BOSSIOU,  Lesotho: P 1837; Rc. James Backhouse visited it in July 1839 and recorded the  following:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;Thaba Bossiou signifies the Mountain  of Night;&nbsp; the kraal of the Basutu Chief,  Moshesh, and four others, are situated on the top, which is to them an  impregnable fortress. The Missionary Station is elevated, but stands under the  mountain. Thaba Bossiou is not only the name of the missionary station, but of  the adjacent mountain, a portion of which, with the mission premises, is  represented in the accompanying etching, in which the Witte Bergen, or  Quathlamba Mountains are seen in the distance on the left. The mission-house  was a long, plain, brick building, of five rooms, affording a moderate share of  accommodation, but not at all more than was needful for health and reasonable  comfort&quot;.</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Casalis reported on missionary plans at  Thaba Bossigo during the station's early days:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;Touching after this on the material  side of our work, we said that, wishing to provide entirely for out own  subsistence, we must have a site where we could build houses and cultivate the  ground according to our own ideas and habits. Our buildings and plantations  would also serve as a model for the Basutos, whom we regretted to see dwelling  in huts, and living in a manner so precarious and so little worthy of the  intelligence with which they were gifted. Thaba-Bossiou did not appear to us to  offer the advantages which we desired. Wood for building was lacking in it.  There were, moreover, no streams that we could turn from their course to help  in various works, and especially to water certain very useful plants which we  proposed to introduce into the country, and which could not, like sorgho and  maize, support a long drought&quot;.</em></p>

          THABA MORENA,  also spelt THABANA MORENA, Lesotho: P 1861<br />
          THABA 'NCHU, also spelt THABANCHU, OFS: SPG  1833; WMS. James Backhouse visited it in July 1839 and recorded the following:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;The Wesleyan settlement of Thaba  Unchu, is situated near the foot of a mountain of that name, which signifies  Mountain of Night. It is the largest assemblage of human habitations in this  part of Africa: it comprises two large Barolong towns and a few smaller  villages, scarcely separated from each other. The mission premises, comprising  a house and chapel, are situated between the two towns.</em></p>
          <p><em>&ldquo;The chapel was built of raw brick and  plastered; its form was that of a T, the top and shaft being each eighty feet  long and thirty wide; it was calculated to hold about 1,000 persons. A school  for adults was held daily, in a room in an unfinished house, that also accommodated  printing apparatus, etc. The pupils varied from sixty to seventy.</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>In 1840 the Rev Willian Shaw visited Thaba  'Nchu and wrote this report, published subsequently by Samuel Broadbent:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;Thaba 'Nchu is the chief settlement  of the Barolong tribe, with which Messrs Hodgosn, Broadbent, and Archbell,  established our first Mission. This is now by far the largest town in British  South Africa; there cannot be less than from eight to ten thousand inhabitants.  The town has a very picturesque, but wild- African appearance. I was much  pleased with the very extensive improvements made by the people, in the  erection of stone walls around, in various parts of the town, forming excellent  courtyards to their conical-shaped dwellings, most of which are kept very neat  and clean&quot;.</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Some years later, in 1862, the Rev William  Impey also visited Thaba 'Nchu, and his report was similarly published by  Samuel Broadbent:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;On Wednesday, May 7th, we reached  Thaba 'Nchu, one of the most important Missions. On my last visit the population  of this largest of South African towns was estimated at ten thousand; since  then it has increased to probably twelve thousand. The town covers a large  area; the houses are of a style much superior to that used by the frontier  Kaffirs, and are all enclosed by substantial stone walls: the aggregate amount  of wall is astonishing. The chapel is a large building capable of containing  about fifteen hundred persons; it is out of repair, and will need a new  roof&quot;.</em></p>

          THEOPOLIS, Bathurst, Cape: LMS 1813. The site is  today still known locally as Theopolis although the mission is recorded to have  closed in 1851. John Campbell visited it in about 1819 and wrote the following:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;Another, founded by the Missionary  Society, at Theopolis, near the mouth of the Cowie River, on lands granted to  the Society by his Excellency, Sir John Cradock, then Governor of the Cape,  from whom also it received its name.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;During the Caffre war this  settlement was attacked three times by thousands of infuriated Caffres, who  were repelled on each occasion; yet they nevertheless succeeded in carrying off  upwards of a thousand head of cattle. In consequence of these repeated attacks,  the (Khoikhoi), under the direction of the Missionary, Mr Ulbricht, (since  dead,) raised with great labour a fortification, composed of strong palisades,  eight or nine feet in height, and capable of containing the whole population,  with their cattle. The sight of this fortification so discouraged the (Xhosa)  that they did not venture to attack them any more.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;The lands of Theopolis, in the  original grant, only extended down the valley to about a mile from the sea; but  encouragement was given, both by Governor Cradock and Colonel Cuyler, the  Landdrost of the district, to expect that afterwards this tract, lying between  the former lands of Theopolis and the sea, should be added to the settlement,  provided the (Khoikhoi) were industrious, and the number of their cattle so  increased as to require more pasturage. While I was travelling in the interior,  his Excellency Sir Rufane Shaw Donkin, acting Governor of the Cape, granted to  Dr. Philip, for the Society, this land, which grant affording free access to  the ocean, as well as more pasturage for the cattle, is likely to prove  extremely beneficial to the settlement. It will operate as an inducement to the  natives to pay more attention to fishing, for which they might find a regular  market at Graham's Town, being only about eighteen miles distant from  Theopolis.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;The greater part of the emigrants  who lately left England for South Africa have settled in the vicinity of  Theopolis, and to the north and NE parts of it. Upon the whole, that part of  the colony is pleasant and well wooded and the soil rich, but it is difficult  to lead water from the rivers upon the grounds for the purpose of irrigation,  owing to the deepness of their channels. Without an artificial watering of the  lands, the produce must be very scanty&quot;.</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>James Backhouse also visited it in April  1839 and recorded the following:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;At this time the population of  Theopolis ranked low in comparison with the (Khoikhoi) of the other stations of  the London Missionary Society, most of the more orderly and industrious  families having removed to the Kat River. The (Mfengu) and (Tswana) residing  here decidedly excelled the (Khoikhoi) in energy and industry. The (Khoikhoi)  resided in cottages, most of which were much out of repair, and the (Mfengu)  and (Tswana) in beehive-huts&quot;.</em></p>

          THEUNISSEN,  OFS: DRCSAO 191O<br />
          THLOTSE HEIGHTS, also spelt THLOTSE and THLOTSI,  Lesotho: SPG 1876. The Station was established by John Widdicombe in 1876. His  book, published in 1895, carried various reports on his experiences there.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;A good deal of our time was spent in  selecting grass nd reeds for thatching purposes. Supplies of these came in  daily, but large quantities of the grass had to be rejected as either too short  or too old for thatching. There was of necessity no fixed standard of price,  and natives are shrewd hands at bargaining. This is especially the case with  the women, and&nbsp; it was they who brought  us most of our supplies ... our first hut was approaching completion, or rather  was sufficiently advanced to be habitable, Ntoana having dragged barrel after  barrel of water up from the fountain at the bottom of the hill and poured it  upon the ground, saturating as far as he was able the spots where he intended  to cut the sods he required.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;Towards the middle of November we  took possession of our hut, though it was not yet properly beam-filled, and  possessed neither door not window. The holes were there, but timber was not to  be had in the neighbourhood, and we had to wait for both door and window until  wood could be procured from Bethlehem, a Free State town about fifty miles to  the north-west of us. But oh, the luxury of even doorless and windowless  rondavel after our long sojourn in the bare and naked veldt! The wind might  howl at night through the two apertures - and it did, though we hung blankets  before them - we were snugly ensconced in our beds, with a roof over our heads,  oblivious to rain or storm. By Christmas six of these round huts were finished,  or at any rate sufficiently advanced for use. Each of them was twelve feet in  diameter, and they comprised a dining-room, store-room, kitchen, and three  bedrooms. We had thus a whole suite of apartments, or six detached residences,  complete for little more than 60 pounds. And these poor rondavels, with certain  small additions, were destined to last us nearly nine years, though certainly  we had no idea of it when we built them.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;Before settling at Thlotse I had  engaged a mason, a white man, from Ficksburg, the nearest Free State village,  to build us a temporary chapel, school, and mission-room of raw brick. I had  only &#8356;150 at my disposal to start with, and this had been most generously  provided by the congregation of S Peter's, Eaton Square, London. Without their  timely aid we should have been unable to build any place of worship at all. The  building we erected was of necessity of the simplest kind, and the smallest  possible dimensions. It was an oblong structure, plastered with mud, unceiled,  and under a flat, galvanised iron roof. It was fifty-four feet long, and twelve  broad, and was divided into three compartments separated from each other by a  thin partition wall. It gave us a chapel twenty feet by twelve, a mission-room  twelve feet by twelve, in which I could receive and converse with the numbers  of heathen who still poured in daily to interview us, and a school-room the  same size as the chapel. Except the cross on its gable, and possibly its small  &quot;carpenter's Gothic&quot; windows, there was little or nothing about the  exterior of such a building which marked it off as one devoted to religious  worship. An accomplished ecclesiologist who came to visit us some time  after-wards protested that I had &quot;put up a ginger-beer shop&quot;, but as  he did not offer to procure the funds wherewith to improve it, or still less to  erect a more seemly and permanent church, his criticism did not distress me,  true though it might be. Anyhow, our poor little &quot;early Sesuto&quot; house  of worship was quite as ecclesiastical and &quot;correct&quot; in its style and  tone as the great Capetown Cathedral (built, of course, long before the advent  of Bishop Gray), which cost so much money that it was said of it that its  bricks, like those of the castle, &quot;were cemented together with silver  instead of mortar&quot;. By the way, speaking of this cathedral, a good story  used to be current years ago as to the uniqueness of its architecture. Two  tourists from England, on landing at the Cape, intent on seeing all that was to  be seen, naturally made their way to the chief church of the place. They paused  in astonishment before its portico, and looked up at its tower. In bewilderment  one said to the other, &quot;What kind of architecture do you consider this to  be?&quot; &quot;Day and Martin&quot; replied his friend. &quot;Day and Martin!  What can you mean?&quot; &quot;Why, do you not see,&quot; rejoined the first,  &quot;that the tower is exactly like two of Day and Martin's blacking bottles -  a shilling one, with a sixpenny one standing on the top of it?&quot; On  entering the sacred edifice they gazed about in greater astonishment than ever.  They had never seen such a remarkable church before. Suddenly the gentleman  with the knowledge of architecture seemed relieved. He had solved the problem.  The church had been built, and rightly so, with a view to the prevention of  idolatry. Accosting the verger, he asked him, &quot;whether any idolatry was  ever practised there?&quot; &quot;Certainly not, Sir&quot;, replied the  astonished guardian of the sacred fane, &quot;certainly not. But what make you  ask such an extraordinary question?&quot; &quot;I thought not&quot;, exclaimed  the young Englishman triumphantly. &quot;I thought not. It would be impossible  - quite impossible. For&quot; - with a sweep of the eye round the building -  &quot;this place is like nothing 'in the heaven above, or in the earth beneath,  or in the water under the earth'&quot;.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;The interior of S.George's is now  very different, but the &quot;two blacking bottles&quot; still remain.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;'Beggars must not be choosers', so I  had to do the best I could with my &#8356;150, which, with a little more added to it  by kind friends in the diocese, provided us with a chapel, school,  mission-room, and six huts.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;The spot on which we settled is one  of the most beautiful in Basutoland. It is situated on the heights above the  confluence of the Caledon and the Thlotse. Right in front, to the east, stand  the Malutis; their bold, lofty, serrated peaks stretching away northwards to  the Mont Aux Sources, and southwards to Matatiele. There was but one village on  the heights when we took possession of our ground. This was the village of  Mapatsueng, the headman of which was an one-eyed old man named Modibetsana. But  though there were few people actually on the heights, there were over a  thousand in the small clusters of villages which encircled this mountain ridge,  and all these people were heathen. Besides these there were many villages, some  large, some small, scattered about in all directions at no great distance from  our settlement, and within easy reach of each other, ...</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;On the Feast of the Conversion of S  Paul, 1877 &ndash; a fitting day for such a work - the Bishop blessed the mission  buildings, and dedicated the little chapel to the service of Almighty God, by a  simple, yet solemn, Service of Benediction. It was a happy day, and one full of  hopefulness for the future. A crowd of heathen testified their interest in this  Mokete (feast) of the Church, and all the Europeans of the neighbourhood, as  well as many from a distance, were present on the occasion. The building thus  dedicated was mean and poor, its flat, unceiled iron roof, and its bare, clay-  plastered walls, bearing witness to the poverty of the mission; ...&quot;</em></p>
          <p><em>During the War of 1880 between the British  and the BaSotho the Mission buildings were turned into military fortifications.  John Widdicombe reported as follows:</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;By the end of September Thlotse had  a defensive force of forty-seven whites and 110 natives, these latter including  Tukunya and his men, and the men of the mounted police. This was a very small  body with which to defend a long, straggling township, in addition to the  Residency and the buildings of the Mission. With as much haste as possible the  place was put into something approaching to a state of defence. Walls, among  them those of our Mission garden and cemetery, were thrown down and levelled to  the earth, in order to prevent the enemy using them as cover. The gaol, with  its enclosed courtyard, was turned into a fort, the sod walls round the police  camp were loopholed, and two large loopholes were made in the east wall of the  mission chapel. Anxious to preserve the chapel as far as possible from  profanation or injury, I had urged the authorities to throw up an earthwork  outside it where it was most exposed to attack, and to use it and the school as  a hospital for the sick and wounded as soon as the campaign should really  begin. This might easily have been done at the time, but my wishes were  overruled, and the poor little chapel was soon afterwards pierced in every  direction with loopholes and used as a barrack&quot;.</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>As a result of damage suffered during the  conflict the Mission's buildings had to undergo extensive restoration during  the following year. John Widdicombe gave the following account:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;The Mission chapel was restored to  us at the end of July, when the garrison vacated it, and we turned our first  thoughts towards its cleansing and repair. It was indeed in a sorry condition.  Its walls were full of holes, its windows without a single pane of glass in them,  and its roof still riddled with shot-holes. Every time it rained the water  streamed down from these holes as from a shower bath; and besides this the  earthen floor was furrowed all over, the walls besmeared and defiled with  grease and filth, and the whole place alive with vermin. By the aid of friends  in England, who had heard of our evil plight and who prayed daily for our  deliverance, we were enabled to restore the building to some degree of decency  and order. The walls were scraped and re-plastered both inside and out, new  corrugated iron roofing was put up, the floor was relaid and re-smeared, new  windows replaced the old, the furniture that remained was repaired, thoroughly  washed and cleaned, and in a few weeks we had the privilege and the joy of again  being able to worship the lord in His own House, and before His own Altar. The  restoration of the school-room was, of course, accomplished at the same time,  and, from a mission point of view, was only second to that of the chapel.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;We re-patched and re-thatched our  rondavels and re-enclosed the garden, planting many young fruit-trees, chiefly  peaches and apples, ...</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;When the chapel was first taken  possession of and loop-holed, and the garden walls thrown down, we were assured  by the authorities that full compensation would be given to us by the  Government for the damage done, or for any losses that the Mission, or we  ourselves, might incur through the war. Forms of claim for damages were sent to  us from Capetown, and these were carefully filled up, and the amounts of the  claims attested and approved by the Basutoland executive.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;A considerable part of the amount  claimed was in compensation for the loss of the Training College building. This  had been levelled to the ground by the troops, and even its site could hardly  now be recognized. Its garden had of course gone also. Nor was this all. Some  of the native refugees, who were still coming in small parties, had taken  possession of the ground, and built their huts upon it. It was therefore  impossible for us to think of rebuilding the institution on its old site; and,  indeed, in view of the still unsettled state of the country, we considered it  highly impolitic to attempt the establishment of a training school at all,  until the advent of more propitious times. We therefore gave up the idea, and,  with the consent of the donors of the original building fund, erected, as soon  as the condition of the country warranted our doing so, a large and well-built  school-room of burnt brick for our day schools, thereby supplying one great and  increasing need of the Mission.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;The August of this year saw an  important addition to our mission buildings in the shape of a new school-room.  My readers will recollect that the buildings hitherto erected were merely  temporary structures of raw brick or sod, plastered with mud; but we felt that  the time had at last come for the realization of our plans as to structures of  a more permanent and substantial character. We greatly needed a mission-house,  our huts being, after so many year's wear and tear, almost beyond repair; but a  still greater need was a suitable school-room for the rapidly increasing  numbers of our children.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;The school-room was a substantial,  well-built structure of burnt brick, fifty-two feet by twenty-eight, under a  galvanized iron roof, and the possession of it enabled us to pull down the  partition wall between the old school-room and the chapel, thereby giving us in  the latter and additional space of twenty feet.</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>In 1885 and 1886 John Widdicombe reported  upon the building of a new mission house at Thlotse Heights:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;The house was substantially built of  burn brick, ceiled, and contained nine rooms. It possessed also a good broad  stoep, to which a verandah has since been added, and last, but not least, it  stood in its own grounds. These latter have since been laid out, and planted  with trees and shrubs; a portion being reserved as an orchard, with a kitchen  garden attached to it.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;During the year we succeeded, by the  help of friends at home and abroad, in enclosing both our compounds with a  strong stone wall, a protection greatly needed now that the sod ones were old  and altogether beyond renewal. The cemetery was also enclosed in the same  manner, and carefully laid out and planted with shrubs and flowers&quot;.</em></p>
          <p><em>In 1887 John Widdicombe told of the  building of a new church at Thlotse Heights:</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;A design, with plans and  specifications, had been carefully prepared some time before, and I immediately  set about getting a competent man to put in at least the foundation stone of  the building.</em></p>
          <p><em>Canon Balfour's promise was speedily  performed, his own purse, I am sure, being considerably lightened by the  transaction; and we had in this way &#8356;500 to start with. This more than  warranted me in having not only the foundation stone laid, but the whole  foundation finished, and accordingly the work was pushed on with vigour, so  that the stone might be ready by Jubilee Day. The foundation was broad and  massive, and reposed upon a bed of gravel, which a few feet deeper ended in  solid rock, and this first part of the work cost just &#8356;200. The design approved  was for a stone building under the roof of galvanized iron. Its exterior length  was to be eighty feet, and its breath thirty-eight, with clergy and choir  vestries on the north side, and a sacristy and porch on the south, and there  was to be a baptistery thrown out at the west end. The interior was simple, but  effective, and not without a certain dignity of its own. A low stone screen  separated the nave from the choir, and the altar was of good proportions and  sufficiently elevated. Such a church would cost at least &#8356;2000, and I resolved  not to undertake the commencement of the superstructure until at least half the  money was ready and waiting in the bank for the purpose.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;It seemed in every way a pity to  build with brick when beautiful white, grey and red sandstone was abundant a  short distance off, especially as the bricks made in South Africa are so  inferior to those used for church building purposes in Europe. We had waited so  long for a church that we were resolved, if possible, to have one which should  be strong and durable in its character, now that apparently the opportunity had  come to realize the hopes of so many years.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;With the approach of spring, I hoped  that the work of building might be resumed, now that we had sufficient money in  hand to warrant a recommencement of the church. So I began to look about for a  competent and reliable builder willing to undertake the work, and found him in  the person of an old friend, Mr Morgan Harries, a resident of Ficksburg, and a  member of the Church. A contract was duly drawn up between us and signed, the  Church officers assisting me in the matter with their advice, and entering into  the proposal with the utmost cordiality. The work was to be resumed in August,  and the building to be finished, if all went well, by the Feast of Epiphany,  1890. Quarrying commenced at once, my old friend Nathanaele Makotoko giving us  permission to &quot;break out&quot; stone wherever we pleased round the  heights. Beautiful stone was abundant at a spot about a mile off, and large  blocks of it soon began to make their appearance on the building ground. Six  men - three whites and three Mauritius Creoles - were at work by the middle of  August, cutting and shaping the stone into the required dimensions, and by the  end of the year the walls began to rise. I had myself to be clerk of the works,  and watch everything, the contractor not being able to be often on the spot;  and any one who has undertaken such a task in a country like Basutoland will  readily realize what it involves. The appliances were few, and both Mr Harries  and myself were at the mercy of the men, who worked when they pleased, and  idled when they took it into their heads to do so. But still the work went on  little by little, the nicely finished blocks of stone accumulated, and the  walls grew gradually higher and higher.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;The work of building came at length  to an end. In spite of many drawbacks and vexations, and much waste of time,  the contractor was true to his contract. By the Feast of the Epiphany, 1890,  the church was almost finished. It quite realized our hopes and expectations,  and has, I think, since won the admiration of all who have seen it. That it was  an enormous gain to the Mission goes without saying. Let us hope that it may  stand as a beacon light upon the heights of Thlotse for many generations to  come. The structure is massive and solid throughout, and the work put into it  thorough and good, from the foundation to the wall plates.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;The fabric when finished had cost  &#8356;1997, almost the exact amount of our estimate. The floor is simply of beaten  earth in the usual African fashion, but covered with cocoa-nut matting,  generously given for the purpose, the sanctuary being partially carpeted in  addition. Such things as stained glass and encaustic tiles are, of course,  things of the future &ndash; probably for the far future.</em></p>

        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;This morning we waited on the Revd  Mr Shaw, Missionary at this station. We were astonished to see the improvements  he had made there in the short span of 3 years. He has built a very excellent  house &amp; a chapel which is also made use of as a school. There is a store  kept by a Mr Walker &amp; a good house for the school master besides a great  many small houses for the (Xhosa), all the latter being built on one plan &amp;  laid out in streets at right angles&quot;.</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>In March 1839 it was visited by James  Backhouse who reported that:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;The Wesleyville station was  despoiled during the late war, and its inhabitants were scattered. Some of them  afterwards settled at the Beeka and at Newton Dale, two stations nearer to the  Colony; others went to other places, and but few returned hither. The houses of  the missionary and artisan were now in a dilapidated state; the end of the  former had fallen in during the late rain. A chapel newly built of stone was  just roofed. A son of John Ayliff, the missionary, kept a store at this  station, in a little wattle-and-dab hut. Stores, if conducted by conscientious  persons, are often useful in such situations; they are an encouragement to  trading, which has a civilizing tendency; but they are hurtful where persons  are allowed to contract debts, as is the case at some of the (Khoikhoi)  Stations. The trade with the (Xhosa) is conducted by barter.</em></p>

          WHITTLESEA,  also known as HILTON, Cape: SAfMS. Thomas Baines visited it in September 1848  and recorded the following:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;Tuesday Sept, 11th went up the rocky  hill over the Police kraal to take a view for Mr Loxton, an inhabitant of  Whittlesea, and, after examining various places, fixed upon the eastern end of  it near the pyramid erected by the surveyors as the spot from which the most  comprehensive view could be obtained, embracing at once, south by west,  the Moravian Institution of Shiloh under charge of Mr. Bonatz, with its  numberless huts, the row of willows, and the cultivated land beside the  Klipplats, and behind it the mountain on which runs the boundary line of the  immense tract of country allotted to it; to the right or west of this the  Katberg, along which the line stretches for several miles till turning north it  reaches the Oxkraal River and runs with it to the Klipplaats, which forms its  eastern boundary, including a space of 30,000 morgen or double that number of  acres.</em></p>
          <p><em>In front of the Oxkraal, or on its north bank,  stands Whittlesea, or at least the few houses forming the nucleus of the future  town, to the SSW, of the hill on which we stood, with its streets, erfs,  allotments, and locations, pegged out and, I believe, now being surveyed.</em></p>
          <p><em>Mr Loxton grew eloquent on the political  wrong of allotting only 2,200 morgen of land to a town while 30,000 were given  to the Mission Station, and it is to illustrate his arguments and bring the new  town into public notice he goes to the expense of having a painting of it. He therefore  is desirous of having all the points of interest carefully attended to, and  particularly its abundant supply of water which must be brought prominently  into notice, especially where a fine street is formed by the junction of the  two rivers. He is also very particular about the water furrows for irrigating  the land. The plain and mountains, he says, with the first rain will be again  clothed with verdure and as I have before witnessed the magical effect of even  a slight shower upon the parched fields of Africa I think it no harm to gratify  him by making the grass grow a little. The Police kraal and huts at the foot of  the hill, SW by W, did not take his attention; nevertheless, as a  characteristic feature I inserted them in their proper place, as well as the  aloes, zamias, broken rocks, and pyramid, in the foreground, which possessed  greater charms for my eye than his. I took bearings of all the points after  sketching, holding the compass first on my knee and afterwards for more  steadiness placing (it) on a stone a little on the south side of the mountain.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;At length, about 10 o'clock, Mr W  signified that he was in readiness and vaulting into his saddle with the  elegance of - I am at a loss for a comparison - he led off toward Shiloh. Here  we saw a black carpenter making very neat and substantial work of some window  frames for a new building&quot;.</em></p>

          WITTEBERGEN, Cape: SAfMS 1843; WMS; LMS. Olive Schreiner  is recorded to have been born here. On 20 May 1897 the following report  entitled &quot;Wittebergen Mission Station&quot; was published by &quot;The  Methodist Churchman&quot; under the byline of &quot;O Brigg&quot;:</p>
       
          <p><em>&quot;This Mission Station is situated on  the south side of the Orange River, about 4 miles from it, at an altitude of  some 4 500 feet above sea level. It is about 28 miles east of Aliwal North. It  was established more than half a century ago by Rev William Shepstone, who had  previously been a Missionary at Hloholwani, beyond Plaatberg in Basutoland, and  who on one of his journeys into the Colony met with a Dutch farmer called Piet  de Wet, living at the hot springs at Buffels Vlei, near where the present town  of Aliwal North stands. Mr Shepstone was recommended by Piet de Wet to  establish a &quot;school place&quot; at the Wittebergen, which was then a wild  and rugged country, and practically unoccupied. There were a few coloured  people living at a fountain where the Herschel Magistrate now lives, and they  subsisted on game. There were also scattered remnants of Bushmen tribes. The  country abounded with game, such as springbok, hartebeeste, eland, quaggas, and  ostriches. There were also wild cats, jackals, baboons, wolves, leopards and  lions; wolves being particularly numerous and dangerous.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;When Mr Shepstone first visited  Wittebergen, he found some Boers living in what is now the Lady Grey district;  and he at first thought of founding his &quot;school place&quot; where Lady  Grey now stands; but on second thoughts he gave up the idea in favour of an  elevated rocky eminence at the foot of the Wittebergen, where there was a large  extent of flat rock, which Mr Shepstone saw at once would make a firm  foundation for his house and church. It was not long before it became known  among the natives far and wide that they could find a home for themselves and  grazing for their stock by going to live near Mr Shepstone; and many who had  been for years harassed by tribal wars took refuge there. Soon Mr Shepstone  found it necessary to build a roomy house and church. A stone foundation was  laid on the bare rock, so as to get a level surface to build on, and then the  buildings were expeditiously made, not with stones or bricks, but with clay  which had been well trampled by oxen; this was put on layer upon layer, the  walls being shaped to the perpendicular by the use of the spade. The roofs were  made of yellow wood, and thatched, some of the &quot;riempjes&quot; being made  from skins of quaggas. As wood was very scarce, the benches in the church were  made of unburnt brick, an aisle was left op the middle of the church, and as Mr  Shepstone wished to seat as many people as possible, the seats were made so  close that it was inconvenient, if not impossible, to kneel at prayer. The  communion rail was neatly made of yellow wood and bamboes cut from the kloofs  of the adjacent mountains&quot;.</em></p>

          WORCESTER,  Cape: RM 1831. Mrs Ross visited Worcester in April 1862 and wrote the  following:</p>
      
          <p><em>&quot;... in the afternoon we passed a  pleasant hour in inspecting the arrangements of the Missionary schools, and  learning the history of their foundation and success. They owe everything to Mr  Esselin, who came to this Colony seven years ago, and settled at Worcester in  the hope of doing some good amongst the neglected coloured folk. About nine  hundred of these poor people were then living at what is now called the  'Location' - a double row of huts and cottages, extending for nearly two miles  out of town - and were almost in a state of barbarism; but so hopefully and  manfully did he set to work, that in a very short time he had got most of them  to attend service pretty regularly, and even display some anxiety to be taught.  The church and school were then both held in a rude, thatched building  belonging to the Town Council, while their pastor was being supported by the  Parent Society at Berlin. After a year or two, he conceived the bold idea of  building a church and schools for the especial use of his flock, the expenses  to be defrayed by the coloured people themselves. To this end he called a  meeting of all the heads of families, and fully entered into the details of his  scheme. He then, addressing first the one and then the other by name, fully  ascertained from them all what amount of time, labour, or material each one  could give towards the erection of the proposed buildings during the ensuing  year. As each man came forward with a distinct promise, according to his trade  or calling, to carry so much material, quarry so much stone, or do the work of  carpenter, mason, or smith for so many days, Mr Esselin entered the name and  all particulars of the public promise into a large book; and then, after adding  up the sum total, he determined to draw his own plan, become his own architect,  and commence the work without delay. He procured a fine piece of ground, near  the market-square, and six months afterwards, with his own hands, he laid the  foundation-stone of one of the handsomest, most convenient, and most  solidly-built churches in the Colony. It was truly a labour of love. Both  pastor and flock worked at it with might and main, and at the end of another  six months the final touch was put to this splendid monument of one man's  unflagging energy and spirit.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;One cannot help being struck by the  order and cleanliness of everything connected with this pile of buildings, both  within and without. From pulpit to belfry it has been reared by poor men, and  owes nothing to charitable support. The church has seats for eight hundred  people ...</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;I learned from the minister, who is  a very able, ingenious, and thoroughly well-informed gentleman, that it was not  until a year afterwards that they were able to complete the schools.&nbsp; But now - many years after their erection -  they look as clean and orderly as if just finished. The white-washed walls are  like snow, the arched roof glistens with stained pine, the floor is clean  enough to eat from, and shines till you can almost see your face in it. There  are four of these schools, built in a sort of quadrangle: one for boys, another  for girls, a third for infants, and the fourth for infants of a larger growth.  Arranged in long rows up each side of the hall were the desks and benches, each  shining as if they had been newly varnished; whereas they owe all their polish  to five years' elbow grease. The infant school was like a little cabinet of  curiosities, everything being on the tiniest scale. From the floor up half-way  to the ceiling rose tier upon tier of highly-polished little benches, and round  the walls were hung every description of bird and beast, well painted; with  lessons on colour, on form, - in fact, everything that a child should learn. No  English school could be more perfectly furnished!&quot;</em></p>

          ZOAR, Cape: DRCSA 1817; Bn 1838. James  Backhouse visited it in October 1838 and wrote the following report:</p>
       
          <p><em>&quot;We visited Zoar, which belongs to  the South African Missionary Society. It has an extensive tract of land,  chiefly rocky, karroo hills; but by the side of the river, there are two  fertile spots, capable of irrigation, containing together upwards of 100  morgens, equal to 200 acres. These are converted into gardens, and planted with  corn. Upon the verge of one of them stands the chapel and a number of huts,  forming the village, which is inhabited by from 3 to 400 (Khoikhoi), including  children. The place was without a Missionary for nearly seven years, and went  to decay. The present Missionary who is placed here by an arrangement between  the Berlin and the South African Missionary Societies, is a pious man, but does  not possess much knowledge of handicraft trades. Some knowledge of these is  highly desirable in a Missionary, both to enable him to make his own dwelling  comfortable, and to teach useful arts to those amongst whom he is placed&quot;.</em></p>

          ZUURBERG, believed to have been in the Cape: No  data available. The site for the location of a proposed Mission Station in the  Zuurberg was visited by John Campbell in April 1813. He reported as follows:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;On examining the ground which we  supposed was that which had been recommended for a missionary station, there  did not appear to be a sufficient quantity of water, and the pools we saw are  probably without water altogether in the dry seasons. There is indeed plenty of  stone for building, on various parts of the ground, the grass is good, and  timber for building abounds in every direction&quot;.</em></p>
          <p><em>ZUURBRAAK, Cape: LMS 1811; DRCSA 1812; SPG 1883.  James Backhouse visited it in October 1838 and wrote the following:</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;The mission-house, chapel, and  school-house are tolerably good buildings; they, as well as two or three  cottages, are whitewashed, and have a neat appearance. At this time a street of  considerable length was laid out; along it a few (Khoikhoi) had erected houses,  and others were in progress, or left half built, and there were many scattered  hovels of sticks, reeds and mud, in which (Khoikhoi) families were living.  About 850 (Khoikhoi) resided here, half of whom were children. Zuurbraak is the  site of a native kraal or village of (Khoikhoi), from which they had never been  driven when the London Missionary Society took them under its care; but so  little were the natural rights of these people regarded, that under one of the  English Governors of the Cape Colony, it was taken from them, and was not  restored till application was made to the Home Government.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;We walked through the street of the  settlement, and entered most of the cottages of the Hottentots, as well as some  of the scattered hovels. The latter were poor places indeed for the residence  of human beings.&nbsp; Some of the cottages  were neatly white-washed inside, and had a coloured surbase of French grey. The  material used for colouring, as well as that used for whitewashing is clay,  found on the Zuurbraak property. The walls of the cottages were of mud, the  roofs thatched: few of the cottages had chimneys: the fires were generally made  in the middle of the floor; the inside of the thatch was consequently black  with smoke. Most of the inhabitants of this settlement were very poor, and some  were old and decrepit&quot;.</em></p>
