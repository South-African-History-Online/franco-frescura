          Village Development Patterns in the Karoo Region of the Cape Colony,
          1806 to 1920</h5>
        <p align="left">Franco Frescura</p>
        <h5>ABSTRACT</h5>
        <p>The growth of settlement in colonial southern Africa  was subject to a complex interplay of factors, which often involved a  combination of indigenous land use, white religious practices, land  speculation, road and railway construction, postal routes, and the interests of  traders, farmers and government agents.</p>
        <p>Although the Dutch   Church was a powerful  driving force in such affairs, and often took a leading role in initiating  settlement, it was by no means central to this process and frequently found  itself manipulated by individual speculators and outside financial interests.  This paper examines the processes that guided small and medium colonial  settlement, and the historical circumstances which influenced their location  and physical form.</p>
        <p>I argue that while the spiritual needs of white settlers were  often the motivation which initiated settlement, other realities such as an  availability of water, suitable cheap land and the existence of an  infrastructure were the preconditions which made settlement possible. I use  information drawn from Colonial archives, Civil Establishment Blue Books and  Post Office Reports to Parliament to show how infrastructure normally preceded  settlement, and that the agencies of colonial government created the  preconditions within which other groups, such as the churches, land speculators  and commercial interests could act. This was found to be particularly true in  the case of the Cape Post Office, where the establishment of a postal agency,  usually bearing the name of the farm upon which it was located, often preceded  the official proclamation of a village by several years, thus indicating the  presence of some form of settlement well before either church or government  surveyor became involved in its setting out (Frescura 2002).</p>
        <p>As such, I deal specifically with the processes of settlement  followed by white immigrants to the Karoo  during the colonial era, between 1806 and 1920. I recognize that, in most  cases, the setting out of these towns and villages was often  racially-segregated in intent, but I have chosen not to discuss this, and have  focused upon events surrounding the genesis of settlement, rather than upon the  details of its subsequent implementation. This decision was made simpler by the  fact that, in virtually all cases, in the early days of colonialism racial  separation was achieved by physical distance, and that black residential areas  were seldom subject to formal planning. Their impact upon the form of early  colonial settlements was thus minimal, and their influence only began to be  felt once the white town or village began to grow in both size and complexity.</p>
        <p>I also need to stress that, while the creation of a structuralist  typology was a necessary introduction to this paper, much of the discussion  which follows is based upon the post-structuralist assumptions that all texts  are subject to sub-textual and contextual readings, and the post-modernist  recognition that architectural form is subject to an inherent language which  allows us to &ldquo;read&rdquo; and interpret its intent.</p>
        <h5>THE PROCESSES OF SETTLEMENT</h5>
        <p>It would be wrong to suppose that colonial settlement in southern Africa always followed the same pattern. It is true that  some stereotypes did exist, such as the one created about the kerkplaats,  or church village, but generally these models presupposed the existence of a  primary reason, either military, or religious, or economic, as the driving  force behind the founding of a settlement. Strictly speaking this was not true,  and history will show that, in most cases, humble farmers, graziers, and  wagon-drivers were also influential in pioneering the site for many a village  or hamlet. In such instances, their decisions were not only guided by practical  considerations and group consensus but, more often than not, were also the  result of historical precedent and pragmatic custom.</p>
        <p>Broadly speaking, the following patterns of town and village  development have taken place in southern Africa  during the colonial era:</p>
        <p><strong>The  Farm Homestead.</strong> This was probably one of the  earliest generators of colonial settlement, and although there are only a few  recorded cases where a farming community became the sole driving force behind  the establishment of a village, the presence of a farmhouse in the colonial  landscape created a prominent landmark to which travellers, itinerant traders,  post riders and wagon drivers were drawn as a stop-over point. Once a place had  become an accepted wagon stop, or uitspan plek, the next logical step  was the establishment of a trading store dealing in staple goods, and a postal  agency to forward mails. Rudimentary wainwright facilities could also be  available. These were often done by the owner of the farm, whose family ran  these facilities. Thereafter, the founding of a village could take any number  of permutations. The farmer could act as a land developer and establish a  village in his own right; or he could donate a portion of his farm to the  Church, in the knowledge that a kerkplaats would raise the value of  adjoining land; or the farm as a whole could be bequeathed to the Church for  the purpose of establishing a kerkplaats; or the Church could purchase  an existing village. In any case, the farmer&rsquo;s family usually retained  ownership of key stands in the village, thus ensuring its economic well-being  over the next few generations, and allowing it to make the transition from  subsistence farming to a commercial economy. In some rare instances the family  would also manage to retain control over key functions, such as water rights or  road tolls, thus extending its interests over the settlement. Consequently, far  from being an altruistic gesture motivated by genuine religious belief, the  donation of farming land to the Church for the establishment of a kerkplaats  was often guided by pragmatic self-interest rather than spiritual fervour. The  competition for the right to &ldquo;donate&rdquo; land to the church could become  quite heated, as it was in the case of Nieuwoudtville, where the conditions  attached to the original donation proved to be too onerous and a new site had  to be found, or Vredenburg, where the land became the subject of a protracted  legal dispute (Frescura 2002).</p>
        <p><strong>The  Wagon Stop or Uitspanplek</strong>.  These usually developed informally on unclaimed land at points where water and  grazing were freely available for draft oxen, or a major ford or river crossing  barred the way, or a convenient stop could be made before or after a mountain  pass. It was not unusual for a trader or an inn-keeper to follow local trends  and establish a businesses near the site, and include a postal agency as one of  their services to the public. Two such places were Ann&rsquo;s Villa and Boontjes River.</p>
        <p><strong>The Kerkplaats</strong>. This is a pattern of settlement which recurs time and again in  the history of Dutch colonialism in South Africa. The missionary John  Mackenzie remarked upon it in 1859:</p>
        <p>&quot;<em>The colonial villages or towns - as  some of them may now be properly termed - have usually grown up round the Dutch  Church as a nucleus; and it has been remarked that these church or town sites  had been chosen with great skill by the Dutch colonists. I have come into  contact with those who had seen the growth of considerable villages from the  solitary farm-house of the first owner. As soon as the church is built, there  is no doubt as to a certain amount of business being done where it  stands</em>.&quot; (1971:  18)</p>
        <p>Sellick, who documented much of the early history of Uitenhage and  its surrounds, commented in 1904 that &quot;most South African towns evolved  from a kerkplaats (church farm) to a dorp (village)&quot;, and that:</p>
        <p>&quot;... <em>knowing the character of the  pioneer, the Government would invest in the outlay of building a drostdy and a  church ... certain that in the end they would be amply recouped for the  expenditure ... Hence, too, originated a custom which obtains in our time &ndash; the  Nachtmaal Service</em>&quot;  (1904)</p>
        <p>Nachtmaal,  which in Dutch translates quite literally to a &quot;night meal&quot;,  is a reference to the last supper held by Christ and his disciples during  Passover. During the seventeenth century the practice of holding of a quarterly  nachtmaal was already an established custom of the Reformed Church in Holland and, in time,  became widespread among Dutch communities living in southern Africa  (SESA 1970). Every three months the residents of a farming district would  travel to the nearest regional centre, ostensibly to worship at the church, but  also to purchase staple goods, conduct business, exchange news, collect mail,  receive Government edicts, court potential spouses, arrange marriages, hold  baptisms, and debate current political events. Wagons would be drawn up on the nachtmaal  plein, a square reserved for this purpose in front of the church, where  most of the social functions associated with it would also be held. The  practice often caused problems for residents of outlying rural areas, whose  settlements were often widespread, and the establishment of many kerkplaats  was motivated by a need to make nachtmaal more accessible to remote  farming communities.</p>
        <p>The pattern of growth followed by a kerkplaats was  approximately the same in most cases. A group of farmers, weary of travelling  long distances every three months for nachtmaal, would petition the  regional Church Council for permission to establish a separate congregation in  their district. Under the guidance of the &quot;mother&quot; church a  site would be chosen and the ground purchased. Sometimes a parishioner would  donate a portion of his farm to the church for this purpose or, in some  instances, land was received as a grant from the Colonial Government. Once  transfer had taken place a surveyor would be employed to set out the village,  with key positions being reserved for the church, a &quot;nachtmaal  plein&quot; or church square before it, a &quot;pastorie&quot; or  parsonage alongside it, and a &quot;drosdty&quot;, the residence for the  local magistrate. The remaining plots were sold off by public auction, and the  profits used to build the church. Stands were usually purchased by local farmers,  who used them to erect a modest dwelling which was then used by the family as a  residence over nachtmaal. As a result most kerkplaate were left  uninhabited for long periods of the year. Emil Holub visited Philippolis, in  the Orange Free State,  in August 1872 and found that &quot;the majority of the houses being  unoccupied, scarcely a living being was to be seen, so that the barrenness of  the spot was only equalled by its stillness&quot; (1881: I: 39). To begin  with, the administration of the settlement was in the hands of the Church  Council, but as the village attracted more permanent residents, so then its  control was allowed to pass over to an elected village management board.</p>
        <p>The  Mission Station. Unlike the kerkplaats, which  set out to create a sense of place from the outset, often as a green-field  development, the mission was a functional and potentially flexible form of  settlement which generally relied upon the presence of a permanent congregation  to define its existence. For this reason mission stations were usually  associated with indigenous settlement and, to all intents and purposes, were  built alongside, or as a component of, an existing village or town.</p>
        <p>The  location of a mission station was also pragmatic, and although few missionaries  were as flexible as Michael Wimmer who, every winter, moved with the Khoikhoi  residents of Kok Fontein to new grazing (Backhouse 1844: 578), many stations  were moved as a result of drought, warfare or the forced relocation of their  congregations. Where a mission station did become permanent, this was usually  followed by the establishment of a trade school or a seminary, and normally  took place once the community it served had gained a measure of land tenure.  Because of their strategic value as trusted members of the local community,  mission stations subsequently also became the locations for the local post  office and, later, the Civil Commissioner&rsquo;s Offices. Once that happened, it was  common for the settlement to be rapidly advanced to the status of an  administrative headquarters for a magisterial district.</p>
        <p>The  Military Post. This  was usually located at a key strategic location, either overlooking a valley,  or controlling access over a pass, or a river crossing. Where such  fortifications were relatively minor outposts, housing less than a score of  men, these were usually abandoned at the end of hostilities. However, many of  the larger establishments attracted a variety of traders, inn-keepers and other  service providers, and although the withdrawal of the military from the frontier  regions of the Cape in the 1870s was a serious  setback to their fortunes, many military satellite settlements made the  transition to a civilian economy. In some instances, the military also  provided, in times of peace, a place where informal trading between white  settlers, indigenous farmers and commercial hunters could take place. This was  also true of some fortified homesteads on the Cape&rsquo;s  eastern frontier. Military posts were almost entirely male in their demographic  make-up, and what few women lived there, were impermanent camp-followers.</p>
        <p>The  Military Garrison Town and Village.  Unlike the larger posts, whose civilian component initially developed as an  informal adjunct to military activity, garrison towns and villages were set out  by the military with civilian residential, commercial and military sectors in  mind. Some sites, like those of Grahamstown, Queenstown and Graaff-Reinet, were  chosen with a defensive function in mind, while others, like Berlin and Stutterheim were intended to  house soldier-farmers. Although garrison settlements were initially patriarchal  in nature, their planners also made provisions for the eventual normalization  of their demographic make-up, and planned for the civic, educational and  spiritual needs of a civilian population.</p>
        <p>The Railway Village. Three types of settlement typified  the spread of a railway infrastructure into the southern African hinterland.  The first was the labour camp, which was normally located at the  head of a particular line, and was thus temporary in nature. A common location  for these camps was the local uitspan plek which, quite often, was  already the site of a trading store or an inn, such as was the case at  Middleton. In most cases, at the end of the contract, the builder would  dismantle the village, sell the prefabricated houses off to local farmers, and  move on to the next site. In a few instances, however, the village was bought  out by a local investor and allowed to stand. Two such examples were located at  Blanco, and at Bennetsville, which was later renamed Klapmuts. The second was  the railway station, which could either replace the labour camp  at the head of a railway line, or could be located arbitrarily along the line  to serve the needs of an existing farming community or, in a few notable examples  such as De Aar and Stormberg Junction, was developed as a full settlement at  the junction of two or more main lines. Satellite villages which developed  alongside stations were normally dependant upon the railway and its attendant  functions as a source of income, and normally included a trading store, a  hotel, which was, more often than not owned by the Railways, and the homes of a  handful of railway employees. A telegraph office was invariably located in the  railway station, but the presence of a post office was optional. When one was  established, this could be run either by the hotel, or the store keeper, or by  the Railways themselves. The third was the railway halt or railway  siding, which seldom involved any major settlement, and was usually  only a hamlet of a few railway houses whose residents were employed in local  line maintenance and the service of passing locomotive traffic. Indeed, the  economic survival of most such settlements was so reliant upon the continued  patronage of the Railway, that once South African Railways began converting  their locomotives to diesel fuel during the 1960s, most of these hamlets and  railway stops began to slowly fade off the geographical map of South Africa.</p>
        <p>The Company Village. This was commonly established by major  commercial or manufacturing concerns to house their own employees. Good  examples of such developments could be found at Indwe, and at the Somerset West  Dynamite factory. Elsewhere there are also recorded cases where commercial  concerns overtook the needs of an existing settlement. The Concordia mission  grounds were largely taken over by the Concordia Copper Mining Company, while  the Berlin  missionaries at Pniel suffered the same fate at the hands of innumerable  diamond diggers. In many instances local postal services continued to be  heavily subsidized by the Company concerned as a service to its own employees.</p>
        <p>Convict  Labour Camps.  Although these were transitional settlements, much the same as railway work  camps, there is evidence that, in some instances, they survived beyond their  initial function. The nature of their locations tended to vary, and although  the government often leased a portion of a neighbourhood farm for the duration  of the work, they also used local wagon stops, which were public domain, and  hence cost nothing. Their postal needs were met by either a local field-cornet,  who transported their mail as part of their normal governmental duties, or by  the camp&rsquo;s Master of Stores, who then became its designated postmaster  (Frescura 2002: 191-3).</p>
        <p>Government  Administrative Centres.  The establishment of administrative villages was commonly charged to local  magistrates, following the declaration of their district as a division. The  site was chosen for its central position and strategic potential, and was  usually located on land purchased from local farm-owners for this purpose. Once  laid out, stands were sold to the general public by auction, with a number of  sites being reserved for religious, civic and educational purposes. In the case  of the Transkei,  this work was given over to the local Commissioner for Native Affairs. Land was  normally granted for this purpose by the local Chief and, at the discretion of  the Commissioner, could be located either alongside the Royal village, or Great  Place, as it was commonly known, or some distance away. However it was not  unusual for the mission station and the Government buildings to be built in  close proximity to each other.</p>
        <h5>REGIONAL  PATTERNS OF SETTLEMENT</h5>
        <p>It is also true that, like architecture, certain types of  settlement have predominated in specific regions, giving rise to patterns which  have been subsequently recognized as determinant factors in the cultural and  physical character of a region. The most distinct&nbsp; colonial settlement regions of the Cape have been as follows:</p>
        <p>The Western Cape, where most major towns were a mixture of Government  administrative centres and kerkplaate. Secondary settlement was the  result of Church, missionary, trader and land speculator activity, while  tertiary settlement was predominantly the result of land speculation and  railway expansion.</p>
        <p>The Southern Cape followed approximately the same patterns as those established in  the Western Cape,  except that Government administrative centers were in a slight numerical  majority, and that fewer secondary centers of population were present.  Secondary and tertiary settlements were largely the result of land speculation  and commercial expansion. The railway only became a factor at a later date.</p>
        <p>The Eastern Cape and Border Region, where the number of primary Government  and Church towns was more or less equal, but the number of secondary and  tertiary settlements established showed a marked military and missionary  presence. Commercial concerns also featured strongly in the survey numbers.</p>
        <p>The Transkeian territories, where almost all major towns were established either by the  military, or missionaries, or by the Government, while virtually all secondary  and tertiary settlement was the result of commercial and missionary activity.  The railway played virtually no role in this region.</p>
        <p>The West Coast and Far Northern Cape, where virtually all major centers of  population were established either through the Church or mining activity, while  other centers were predominantly tertiary settlements founded by missionaries  and traders.</p>
        <p>The Bechuanalands where, with the exception of Kimberley and Barkly West, few settlements  qualified as either first or second rank centres of population. Most settlement  in the region was the result of a missionary and trader presence, while the  larger towns were established as mining centres.</p>
        <h5>THE KAROO REGION</h5>
        <p>For the purposes of this survey the Karoo  has been deemed to cover some twenty-five colonial divisions, spanning from Worcester in the south  through to the Gariep in the north, and from Namaqualand  in the west through to the Sourveld in the east. These included:</p>
        <p>Aberdeen, Albert, Beaufort West,  Britstown, most of Calvinia, Carnarvon, Colesberg, Fraserburg, Graaff-Reinet,  Hanover, Hopetown, Jansenville, most of Kenhardt, Laingburg, Middelburg,  Molteno, Murraysburg, Philipstown, Prieska, Prince Albert, Richmond,  Steynsburg, Sutherland, Victoria West and Willowmore.</p>
        <p>Other divisions, such as Cradock and the southern OFS, were  considered to be marginal, while the settlement of Hay and Gordonia were beyond  the time-frame of this paper. Settlements with a population of 1000 persons and  over were listed as towns, or primary settlements; those with a population of  100 to 1000 persons were deemed to be villages, or secondary settlements; while  anything with less that 100 persons was listed as a hamlet, or tertiary  settlement.</p>
        <p>Using data drawn from the Colonial Cape Post Office from 1806  through to 1910, the Karoo was the location of  some 429 settlements, of which 35 were towns (8%), 17 were villages (4%), and  377 were hamlets (88%). The majority of these, 281 or 65%, were associated with  farming communities and probably consisted of little more than a farm trading  store or a Field-cornet&rsquo;s post restante service. Another 54, or 13%,  were minor railway stations or sidings and, again, probably consisted of little  more than a trading store, a group of houses for railway employees, and  sometimes, a hotel. However, for the purposes of this analysis, we are only  concerned with the larger towns and villages, which number no more than 52, or  12% of the total.</p>
        <p>Using this number as a guideline for the settlement culture of the  Karoo, we can establish that 16 (31%) were  first established as kerkplaate, 15 (29%) were founded by land speculators,  7 (14%) by the railways, 6 (11%) by missionaries, 5 (9%) by the Cape Government,  and 3 (6%) arose as a result of mining and other commercial activities.  Obviously the lines of definition were not always as clear-cut as this. The  village of Loxton, for example, was founded in 1897, but only began to flourish  after the DRC purchased it in 1899 and, whatever their origins, most Karoo  settlements made provision, in their planning, for the establishment of a Dutch  church and an adjoining &ldquo;nachtmaal plein&rdquo;. It can probably be concluded,  therefore, that although the Dutch Reformed Church did play a strong role in  the establishment of settlements in the Karoo,  its contribution in terms of numbers is much more limited than the cultural  stereotype for this region would lead us to believe. This finding is reinforced  when the origins and nature of the Karoo built  environment are also considered.</p>
        <h5>THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT OF THE KAROO</h5>
        <p>The domestic building form most closely associated with the Karoo is the flat or mono-pitch roofed cottage. This  dwelling originated in Cape Town  in the mid-eighteenth century and rapidly spread into the southern African  interior, in time becoming associated over the next two centuries with a wide  range of rural, as well as urban, environments. In the process it has also  gained for itself a variety of names, having been identified, from time to  time, as the preferred residential form of Karoo, Griqua and Dutch farmers, as  well Cape Town&rsquo;s newly-emancipated Malay community. In more recent times its  construction has also spread onto the highveld where it has been incorporated  into the indigenous range of dwelling forms (Frescura 1989). Its origins,  however, are linked to the &ldquo;langhuis&rdquo; tradition, which link it both to  the Cape cottage and, less directly, to the  high-design tradition of Cape   Dutch architecture (Floyd  1983).</p>
        <p>It can be assumed that, towards the end of the 1700s, the  flat-roofed dwelling was found to be ideal for the more arid conditions of the  interior and within a short time began to be identified with the domestic  architecture of Dutch farmers in the Karoo.  The method of this diaspora has yet to be fully documented, but it can  be assumed that a general shortage of suitable building timber in this region  probably made its use almost mandatory.</p>
        <p>What is in question here, however, is not the architectural  character of the Karoo itself, so much as who  was responsible for developing it. Of the 52 major towns and villages in the  greater Karoo region, only four were founded  before 1840 and just over 60% of them were begun after 1861. By this time the  dissident Dutch farmers had already trekked northward and founded Winburg  (1836), Potchefstroom and Pietermaritzburg (1838), Bloemfontein (1846) and Pretoria (1855) and had settled as far north  as Schoemansdal by 1849. Thus although Holub was led to comment in 1873 that:</p>
        <p>&quot;<em>In its general aspect, Fauresmith (founded in 1850) is very like the other  towns in the Free State ... consisting of not more than eighty houses, ...  clean white-washed residences, flat-roofed as elsewhere</em>&quot; (Holub 1881:  I: 43).</p>
        <p>a pictorial survey of other early Voortrekker towns further north  reveals that only a small number of their dwellings were flat roofed and that  indeed, many such structures were of a temporary nature. Colesberg, for  example, was on the northern reaches of the Karoo, and a closer look at Bell's  painting of the town done in 1844, reveals that the more substantial buildings  are all pitch roofed whilst it is mainly the humbler homes and the more recent  arrivals, on the outskirts of the town, which carry flat roofs. Therefore,  whatever else it may have been, the flat roof dwelling was not part of the  political and ideological impedimenta carried by dissident Dutch farmers to  their new homes, and its spread into the southern African hinterland was not  dependent upon the urbanization of the region.</p>
        <p>Our knowledge of individual flat roofed farm houses is even more  scattered. Early examples built by missionaries were recorded by Backhouse in  1839 at the Bethany  (1844:357-359) and Beersheba  mission stations in the OFS (1844:421), and at Afrikaner's Kraal in Namaqualand in 1840 (1844:561). Baines recorded  flat-roofed dwellings at Colesberg in 1848 and at Bloemfontein in 1850 (1964:35).</p>
        <p>It was also during this era that the flat roofed house became  identified, for a brief period of time, with the Griquas of the northern Cape and  western OFS. In 1859 Mackenzie remarked how they &ldquo;have all chosen the Dutch  colonists as their model in social life and manners, although most of their  missionaries have been Englishmen&quot; (Mackenzie, 1961:61). Remarkably,  once this group migrated to Griqualand East in 1862, a region endowed with a  better rainfall and richer in thatching grasses, they abandoned the flat roofed  dwelling and built for themselves ridged and gabled cottages (Dower 1902).</p>
        <p>The Griquas represent an important case study which demonstrates  how their cottages, whose roofs in the western    Cape had historically been built in a pitched or  ridged and gabled form, reverted back to this once similar climatic and  environmental conditions were re-established. It is not known whether their  plan conformed with the Cape two-cell  longhouse derivative, but photographs taken in about 1878 indicate that its  outward form was similar to that of the Cape  cottage (Dower 1902).</p>
        <p>Evident, also, are the social and economic factors which generated  the flat roofed house during the early years of the eighteenth century.  Barrow's account of &quot;apartments, nearly destitute of furniture&quot;,  Sparrman's tale of houses of &quot;but two rooms, somewhat more than two  yards in breadth&quot; and Baines' picture of Colesberg are all indicative  of one fact: at best the rural flat roofed home was a humble structure. Some  might even say that it was &ldquo;a poor man's residence&rdquo;, or at the very  least, the temporary abode of graziers, occupied but a few months of the year.  Even the buildings erected in new settlements such as Philippolis, laid out as  a town in 1862, were not exempt from this definition. Holub, who visited it ten  years later described its aspect as being &quot;<em>most melancholy ... Equally  dreary were the flat roofed houses, about sixty in number, and nearly all quite  unenclosed, that constituted the town; ... the majority of the houses being  unoccupied, scarcely a living being was to be seen&rdquo;</em> (Holub, 1881:I:39).</p>
        <p>Quite clearly Philippolis, which was begun as a station of the  London Missionary Society in 1821, owed its existence by 1872 to the Dutch  practice of &quot;nachtmaal&rdquo;. It was quite common for farmers to build  themselves town residences called &quot;tuishuise&quot; to serve their  housing needs during nachtmaal and these were normally covered with a  flat roof. This would certainly explain why Philippolis was mostly unoccupied  during Holub's visit. It seems probable that other towns in the Karoo also presented visitors with the same aspect. By  the 1880s Middelburg was said to have several well-built houses and stores, but  the majority of its dwellings were of more modest construction &quot;<em>being  only used by the Boers when they come in to Nachtmaal once a quarter</em>&quot;.</p>
        <p>Quite clearly then, the rural flat roofed house of southern Africa has always been associated with the temporary and  newly urbanised elements of rural society. This image has been compounded in  more recent times by its increasing identification with informal urban  settlements as well as the landless and dispossessed black farmers of the  highveld region.</p>
        <p>This then gives rise to a dichotomy for, on the one hand, the  urban flat roof aesthetic was generally associated with statements of urban  style, fashion and &quot;high design&quot; whilst in rural areas the  same form belonged to a more humble tradition of folk architecture. It must  also be borne in mind that although the tuishuise clustered about the  village nachtmaal plein may have been of a temporary nature, they were  not necessarily the product of indigent farmers. Quite the contrary, in fact,  they were probably the town residences of farming families of substance, who  were wealthy enough to afford the maintenance of two homes.</p>
        <p>Thus it might appear that, by the late nineteenth century, the  relationship existing between the flat roofed town house and the rural cottage  may outwardly appear to have become somewhat remote. This, however, is not  correct. Indeed it was the humble rural dwelling which was to provide the more  sophisticated urban structure with a sense of cultural and architectural  continuity which permitted it to develop and achieve urban respectability.  Rapoport discussed this viewpoint in 1969 when he postulated that vernacular or  folk tradition is the common matrix, the clay, which makes high design  architecture possible, and that the two combine to form a total spatial and  hierarchic system (Rapoport 1969). Viewed in these terms therefore, the adapted  longhouse or Cape cottage may also be seen to  form the basis for both the townhouse architecture in the western Cape as well as the more modest  cottage dwellings of the Cape interior,  regardless of their respective aesthetic and cultural status.</p>
        <p>The spread of the flat roofed dwelling out of the western Cape probably  began in the 1770s, and its spread into the larger Karoo  appears to have been somewhat limited. It is probable that the major thrust of  this movement lay eastward along the rain shadow provided by the Langeberg and  Outeniqua mountains, a semi-arid area which has since become more popularly  known as the &quot;Klein Karoo&quot;. This is supported by the fact that  by the mid 1830s, the major settlements in this region were located at  Calitzdorp (founded in 1821), Knysna (1817), Port Elizabeth (1820), Uitenhage  (1806), Somerset East (1825), Graaff-Reinet (1786), Cradock (1816) and  Colesberg (1830), all of them being located on the fringes of the Karoo, whilst  only one, Beaufort West (1820), was located in the Karoo itself.</p>
        <p>Even then its spread there was slow and even minimal. The imported  cottage architecture of the newly arrived English adapted easily to local  conditions in the eastern Cape  and proved singularly unwilling to convert to a local flat roofed technology.  From the onset the early residents of new settlements such as Grahamstown, Port Elizabeth, Uitenhage  and Fort Beaufort all showed a distinct  preference for pitch roofed houses. Similarly, the Dutch themselves did not  built flat-roofed farmhouses in this region to any great extent, even as far  north as the Sneeuwberge, immediately beyond Graaff-Reinet, where some flat  roofed structures are recorded to have been built, but only after the 1850s  (Whitlock 1989). Before this time much of this development appears to have been  focused upon Graaff-Reinet where Thompson, who visited the town in 1823,  described it as consisting of approximately three hundred neat and commodious  brick buildings, some of which had flat roofs with simple moulded cornices  (Minnaar 1987: 11). On the other hand it is recorded that some English  immigrants who took over farms from the newly departed Dutch found flat roofed  homesteads already standing there and, in many cases, restored and adopted them  to their own use (Lewcock 1963).</p>
        <p>Most development appears to have taken place after the early  1860s, and probably owed much to the introduction of corrugated iron into  southern Africa. It is true that various forms  of flat metal sheeting, such as lead, zinc and copper had been available in the  Cape for some time, but such roofs were  generally considered to be too light and labour intensive, and never gained  widespread usage. Corrugated iron sheeting, on the other hand, was durable and  easily portable and the first iron buildings appeared in Cape Town as early as 1847 (Lewcock 1963).</p>
        <p>The technical and economic performance of corrugated iron rapidly  proved to be vastly superior to that of other waterproofing methods tried  previously at the Cape, and it soon began to  replace the flat roof technology of earlier times. Although at first its  availability was limited to the larger urban centres, by the 1870s and 1880s,  it had rapidly spread into other areas where it found widespread usage in both  the domestic and industrial sectors. Inevitably it was only a matter of time  before it became synonymous with flat roofed architecture.</p>
        <p>It was during this time that most of the major towns and villages  of the Karoo were established. Following the  founding of Graaff-Reinet in1786, Beaufort West in 1820, Calitzdorp in 1821,  and Colesberg in 1830, expansion into this region quickened and over the next  twenty years, up to 1860, some seventeen more villages were begun.  Significantly most of this development occurred in the southern part of the Karoo where a wool farming industry was beginning to  flourish.</p>
        <p>The decade between 1861 and 1870 was a period of economic  depression marked by droughts and the failure of a number of local banking  institutions. This had a marked effect upon the development of the Karoo with only six settlements being founded there  during this time.</p>
        <p>The discovery of diamonds in the northern Cape in 1867 marked the start of an  era of strong economic development for the southern African interior. This and  the spread of a railway infrastructure throughout the Cape during the 1880s and  1890s effectively opened up the northern Karoo for settlement and over the next  thirty years, up to 1900, 36 villages were founded. This was further assisted  by two separate feather farming booms, one in the Albany district in the 1880s  and the other, more importantly for the Karoo, in Oudtshoorn during the 1900s.  Thereafter the South African war of 1899-1902 brought the settlement of the Karoo to a virtual halt, and between 1900 and 1920 the  establishment of only five new villages was recorded. The one centre which  benefited most from this economic growth was Port Elizabeth which, during the 1870s,  became the centre of wool, feather and, for a time, diamond marketing (Wilson  and Thompson1975).</p>
        <p>Thus the predominant architectural character of the Karoo was not  established whilst this area was under the administration of either a Dutch or  even an early English colonial government; nor was it established to any great  extent before the introduction of corrugated iron in the region during the 1860s  and 1870s; it was established between 1870 and 1900, at a time when this region  was under the political and economic influence of the eastern Cape, a region  where the English predominated. Signs of a growing English presence in the Karoo were becoming evident as early as the 1850s. On 25 August 1852 the  Graaff-Reinet Herald published the following editorial:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>&quot;<em>It may perhaps be a matter of  surprise that an English paper should spring up in a district hitherto  considered almost exclusively Dutch. It will appear perfectly natural however,  when it is known that many frontier English have been compelled by the (Xhosa)  wars to settle in this district, and that many educated Dutchmen are so well  versed in English as to prefer it to their own language.</em>&quot; (Smith 1974: 64)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This is supported by other evidence. Although no hard demographic  data appears to exist regarding the language makeup of the Cape  during this time, an analysis of the colony's civil lists reveals that, by  1860, 57% of all Colonial Government employees came from English backgrounds.  By 1870 this figure had risen to 71% and by 1879 to 73% (CGH Blue Books).</p>
        <p>A division-by-division breakdown of these figures plotted out on a  map also makes for interesting reading. In 1870 the suburban area of the western Cape showed a  strong English bias. This was separated from the rest of the country by a belt  of strong Dutch presence stretching in an arc from Calvinia in the north to  Stellenbosch and Caledon  in the south to Oudtshoorn in the east. Beyond that, however, the southern and  eastern Cape were almost overwhelmingly English, the southern Karoo showed a  good mixture of English and Dutch, with the English being in slight  predominance, and the areas north of that showing a strong English presence. A  similar map for 1879 shows essentially the same patterns with areas of English  and Dutch mixes spreading into both Namaqualand, Paarl, Caledon and Bredasdorp  and a growing English presence in the northern and central Karoo. Although it  is probable that these figures reflect a bias in civil service employment, they  do nonetheless reveal that the Cape middle  class, which would have provided many of these bureaucrats, and who,  presumably, would also have built a large proportion of the new urban homes of  that time, was English to a considerable extent.</p>
        <p>It becomes clear therefore that if the flat roofed house should,  in any way be considered to be typical of the domestic architecture of the Karoo, then its construction in urban areas was as much  the result of English home building as it was of the Dutch. Indeed once the  humble &quot;brakdak&quot; was superseded by corrugated iron after the  1860s, there is every reason to believe that the flat roofed home was simply  added to the range of domestic structures available to local speculative  builders (Radford 1988: 19-21). Many of these, then, would not have been built  as a reflection of local cultural preferences but merely because, by that  stage, they represented a style of construction linked to the fashionable town  house of the Cape, a structure which, it was seen, enjoyed a large degree of  urban respectability.</p>
        <h5>CONCLUSIONS</h5>
        <p>Historical  revisionism can be intellectually satisfying, but it can also be highly  misleading. To prove that the architectural and cultural make-up of a region is  the product of complex interactions between a number of different groups is one  thing, but to persuade a people that their cognitive memories are the result of  myths and historical constructs is quite another matter. For this reason I  prefer the analogy of an empty house. For better or for worse, the builder of a  dwelling will, at the outset, establish patterns of living which, subsequent  residents will find difficult to alter without resorting to radical change, and  even demolition. The first patterns of permanent settlement in the Karoo were established by Dutch farmers, and although  other parties were willing participants in this process, they adhered to many  of the values inherent in Dutch settlement. The material and economic  development of Karoo towns and villages then  passed over to an increasingly English body of residents, whose patterns of  life did not differ radically from their Dutch predecessors, and who were  sensitive enough to respect the values they found. After the colonial era, the  increasing urbanization of Dutch, now called Afrikaner, farmers, brought about  a reversal in the demographic make-up of the Karoo,  which was probably accelerated after the 1960s, reinforcing a growing body of  opinion which held the Karoo to be a &ldquo;heartland&rdquo;  of Afrikaner culture. Who is going to own the &ldquo;construct&rdquo; of the Karoo&rsquo;s cultural identity in future generations is wide  open to conjecture.</p>
        <h5>POSTSCRIPT</h5>
        <p>This paper was originally presented to a symposium on Understanding and Using Urban Heritage in the  Karoo, Victoria West, 3-5 March 2002, under the title of The Preacher,  the Farmer and the Land Speculator - Village development patterns in the Cape Colony.  I expect to be submitting it for formal publication in the immediate future.</p>
