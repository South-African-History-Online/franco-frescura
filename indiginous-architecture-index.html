	  <h5 align="left"><br />INTRODUCTION</h5>
	  <p>The creation of an indigenous architecture in southern Africa has always been part of a larger process whereby  both the individual dwelling unit and the larger homestead or village derive  their existence from the found and natural materials of the physical  environment. They use their immediate surrounds as a ready quarry for the  timber, the stones, the clay and the grass required for their construction.</p>
	  <p>Theirs therefore is a highly functional kind of architecture which  uses materials according to their natural properties. As a result the form of  dwellings, the size of settlements and even the resolution of certain  structural details, such as the roof apex, have all been subjected to different  environmental forces leading to certain regions developing strong architectural  identities in their own right. In spite of these outward differences however,  all rural architecture is linked by the fact that this habitat is part of a  delicate environmental balance which brings together human settlement, economic  activity, physical environment and culture into one larger interacting whole.  Thus if one of vernacular architecture's attractions lies in its seeming  ability to merge with immediate surrounds, that is because it draws upon its  social and physical environs for its very being.</p>
	  <h5>THE  ECOLOGY OF THE DWELLING UNIT</h5>
	  <p>Traditionally the dwellings of rural southern Africa  have been built predominantly out of saplings, timber, clay, grass and cow  dung. Depending on the region, stone rubble and shales have also been used in  wall construction while natural lime has been found to be a good soil  stabiliser. However, being natural materials, these have also tended to provide  a home to a variety of insects, lizards and other small fauna which can subsist  alongside, or even in spite of, man. This has led to the rural dwelling  developing an internal ecological balance of its own, with man and his  activities on the one hand, providing a check to the infestation of his environment  on the other. Thus it was found, during the course of current research, that  when rural residents built fires in their dwellings for both heating and  cooking, their smoke rose and percolated through the thatch grass roof thus  effectively fumigating it and discouraging vermin infestation.</p>
	  <p>To a certain extent this process must also be assumed to be  effective where clay walls are concerned. Therefore, should a family decide,  for any reason, to change their grass roof and replace it with zinc sheeting, they  will no longer be able to build an effective fire within it without the  assistance of a smoke flue. As in the majority of cases the flue has not found  popular application in the region's architecture, it is likely that this group  would soon cease to build internal fires in their dwelling thus terminating the  fumigating process. One probable result of this action will be that they will  need to introduce cement and brick into the structure in order to reduce or  eliminate infestation of the walls. Once a family initiates the use of cement,  it is also likely to cut down on its maintenance efforts by using this material  in the floor. However cement floors are hard and cold to sleep on and therefore  European- style furniture will have to be bought to replace traditional grass  sleeping mats. By implication then, such a family will be making a transition  from a local subsistence and craft- manufacturing economy to an externally  based cash-using society. However, in view of the fact that industrially  manufactured furniture is normally based upon a 90&deg;geometry  and that circular floor plans are thus difficult to furnish, a change in  fittings might also bring about a change in the dwelling's floor plan from the  circular to the square, thus also forcing a change in its roof technology.</p>
