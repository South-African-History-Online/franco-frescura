	    AN ASSESSMENT OF ITS ARCHITECTURAL NEEDS  IN THE 21ST CENTURY</h5>
	  <p align="left">Franco Frescura</p>
	  <h5>INTRODUCTION</h5>
	  <p>The creation of hypothetical new social orders and economic  systems set in future environments is not novel to modern literature and may be  traced as far back as Plato's &quot;The New Republic&quot;. More  recently writers have been using a literary form more popularly described as  &quot;science fiction&quot; to explore future alternatives, usually  highlighting and exaggerating individual modern trends and allowing them to  assume almost obsessive proportions. Whilst these have been valuable as a means  of exposing the current follies and foibles of modern society, it also means  that few such works of fiction in the past have been based upon a realistic assessment  of existing social, political and economic conditions. Most predict the  widespread breakdown of society, either through over- population, breakdowns of  infrastructure, devaluation of social values, pollution or nuclear holocaust;  almost none go through a historically derived pattern of cause and effect to  project a series of realistic future scenarios.</p>
	  <p>One of the few such works which understood and made use of  historical processes was Arthur Keppel-Jones, a professional historian, whose  book &quot;When Smuts Goes&quot; was published in Cape Town in 1947. In it he postulated the  rise, and eventual downfall, of a neo-Nazi South African Reich. He wrote:</p>
	  <p>&quot;<em>On August 24 the sun rose over an  uncannily quiet Pretoria.  The sound of gunfire had died away. Here and there flames still flickered and  smoke rose from wrecked buildings. A pall of smoke and a queer smell still hung  over the city. Hundreds - some thought thousands of vultures circled about in  the putrid air. The war was over. Bult was dead. His Republic was dead. The  history of his people had come to an end</em>&quot;. (Arthur Keppel-Jones. When Smuts Goes.  Cape Town,  1947)</p>
	  <p>In spite of some obvious miscalculations, his predictions proved  surprisingly accurate on a number of issues. The value of such role-playing and  future projections should therefore not be underestimated.</p>
	  <p>To a certain extent the role of this workshop should be considered  in a similar light, although its theme, &quot;Black Government&quot;, is  probably but one of the options open to this country in future years. For the  purpose of this paper I have accepted that a &quot;majority government&quot;,  as I prefer to call it, is more than a probability in our future: it is, to my  mind, a historical certainty. Certainly an increasing number of influential  people and institutions are also beginning to heed this contingency. But a  majority government would not be born de facto: it would be subject to a  number of historical preconditions which would have an important bearing upon  the formulation of its policies in the short, medium and long term.</p>
	  <p>Therefore if this paper is to avoid the pitfalls of wishful  thinking, or join the ranks of fiction, it needs to be based upon premises  derived either from current conditions or modelled after parallel events in  neighbouring countries.</p>
	  <p>I might also suggest, at this point, that the identification and  analysis of major trends in modern South African society, and their projection  into a series of alternative futures for the region might well be the subject  for a similar workshop session at some future time.</p>
	  <p>Inevitably the nature of this paper necessitates that it also make  a number of assumptions which are unavoidably based upon personal experiences  and philosophies. The use of apartheid-based terms, such as &quot;Homeland&quot;,  &quot;Black&quot; and &quot;White&quot;, is being made in the  context of current political ideology and must not be interpreted to condone  the philosophies they represent.</p>
	  <p>Particular stress should also be laid upon the importance of  making such projections, no matter if, in retrospect, subsequent events  relegate them to the realm of fiction. Their relevance lies in the process of  formulation, rather than in their final prognostications. Little such thinking  and debate is currently taking place in the professions.&nbsp; As a result idealistic and socially aware  young graduates are having great difficulty in visualising a role for  themselves in either present or a hypothetical &quot;future South African  society&quot;. Many who reject the present socio-political order are  leaving the country in self-imposed exile. Others are finding it impossible to  practice their skills and, as a result, are turning to make their mark in other  fields. Either way the country is alienating professional expertise from fields  where it can least afford to.</p>
	  <h5>A FEW  HISTORICAL PROJECTIONS</h5>
	  <p>It is assumed that South    Africa will achieve a majority government at  some future, if unspecified, date. Two major methods of transition present  themselves:</p>
	  <h5>1. THE  HARD OPTION</h5>
	  <p>This is likely to involve massive mobilisation of population;  possible external military intervention; large-scale conflict and hence  widespread damage to the country's physical infrastructure. In architectural  terms this would mean extensive post-war reconstruction of a scale and nature  beyond the scope of this paper, being largely dependant upon resources  available and the needs of re-establishing vital services.</p>
	  <h5>2. THE  SOFT OPTION</h5>
	  <p>This  could include a combination of any number of the following:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Change  will be largely the product of a controlled democratic and consultative process,  and will occur within the framework of a debating chamber or a negotiating  table rather than a battlefield.</li>
	    <li>It  will be preceded by a prolonged campaign of rural guerilla warfare and sporadic  strikes against selected urban targets, both military and civilian. This will  have the effect of making optimum use of materials expended as against  publicity achieved.</li>
	    <li>Urban  infrastructural damage is likely to be relatively small and highly unlikely to  approach that suffered in Beirut  during the Lebanese civil war.</li>
	    <li>It  is probable that an interim &quot;Muzerewa option&quot; will be  attempted as a compromise by the ruling regime.</li>
	    <li>Little  large scale urban action will take place.</li>
	    <li>Control  of urban areas is likely to remain in white hands until the change-over occurs.</li>
	    <li>Capital  interests will force negotiation between the parties before extensive damage  can occur to infrastructure.</li>
	    <li>Capital  interests will give subvert financial support to the popular revolutionary  movements should they see the tide turning against the existing political  system.</li>
	    <li>Intellectual,  religious and moral community leaders will withdraw their support from the  regime in increasing numbers as revolutionary movements begin to establish a  moral ascendency over their opponents.</li>
	    <li>Urban  infrastructure requiring extensive funding to maintain will begin to break down  as finances are channelled increasingly into the military effort.</li>
	    <li>There  will be a marked depopulation by whites of isolated farm areas.</li>
	    <li>There  will be a marked depopulation by whites of &quot;vulnerable&quot; urban  areas.</li>
	    <li>There  will be a marked rise in the incidence of absentee landlords in both urban and  rural areas. It is also probable that a gradual, ad hoc handing over of some  white-owned farm lands to black managerial &quot;caretaker&quot; staff  will take place.</li>
	    <li>White  farmers will begin to collaborate or enter into mutual non-aggression pacts  with regional guerilla groups.</li>
	    </ul>
	  <h5>POLICY  DECISIONS INVOLVING ARCHITECTURE AND SETTLEMENT PLANNING</h5>
	  <p>Although this paper chooses to focus on the alternatives arising  out of the &quot;soft option&quot; scenario, some of these  considerations are equally applicable to events subsequent to widespread  conflict.</p>
	  <p>A future majority government must also focus on the differences  between long term but high priority policy, such as housing, as against short  term but relatively low priority policy, such as monuments, statues etc.</p>
	  <p>The provision of high rise housing structures, consisting of two  storeys plus, has, generally speaking, been found to have severe limitations in  underdeveloped countries. Such an option is highly discouraged by this paper.</p>
	  <h5>A.  HOUSING</h5>
	  <h5>GENERAL  POLICY CONSIDERATIONS</h5>
	  <p>The housing policies of a majority government will have to take  into consideration two major factors:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>the  broad economic needs of the country, and</li>
	    <li>the  material expectations and ideological leanings of its grass roots political  support base</li>
	    </ul>
	  <p>Bearing in mind that both factors are subject to separate and  conflicting realities, it is probable that such a government will not attempt  to meet the needs of either in the short or medium term. Instead a majority  government is likely to adopt a differentiated, multi-level approach  accommodating a wide range of housing options. These would take into account  families of differing size, composition and economic background, from labourers  through to professionals, and from single persons through to extended family  units. Such a policy is not only elastic, but is also the most economically  feasible, given the current nature of the national economy. However it is also  designed to meet the needs of an economic middle class already employed and  relatively well-off, and would fail to address such fundamental issues as land  dispossession and &quot;homelessness&quot; among the poor, particularly  in urban areas. A majority government is therefore likely to attempt a &quot;trade-off&quot;  between the two, delaying the implementation of more radical social and  economic programmes until such a time as it is more firmly in control of other  political processes.</p>
	  <p>The housing stock currently held by the government will be sold to  residents for nominal amounts. This however should not be seen as an  opportunist move designed to curry populist political favour. It will be  appropriate and just, for most of these structures were erected between 1956  and 1966 at a cost of about R500 each, an expenditure which would long have  been met by the resident's rentals had they been allowed to purchase their own  homes in the first place. It is also undesirable for a government, any  government, to begin acting the role of a landlord. Selling off these houses  would therefore remove a source of potential political embarrassment as well as  other attendant complications such as maintenance, administration and rent  collection.</p>
	  <h5>SHACK  HOUSING IN URBAN AREAS</h5>
	  <p>A policy of self-help, appropriate technology housing combined  with a system of meaningful collaboration between community and public  authority in the provision of basic infrastructure should be instituted.  However the wider problem of urban drift should also be addressed by a parallel  programme of rural development to encourage food growers to remain on their  lands.</p>
	  <h5>SEMI-URBAN  CONGLOMERATIONS OF SHACK HOUSING IN RURAL AREAS</h5>
	  <p>The rise of semi-urban conglomerations in rural areas, such as the  greater Winterveld, Melalane and Bushbuckridge, to name but a few, poses  serious social and environmental problems both in the short, medium and long  term. These may be aggravated should the current South African government  implement a policy of resettling rural residents in a series of &quot;fortified  villages&quot;, such as those employed in Zimbabwe during the course of their  guerilla war. These may be resolved in the short term through a policy of  self-help housing solutions based upon historical technologies and social  processes. In the medium and long term however, these problems may only be met  through conventional urban solutions involving standard technologies and  infrastructures.</p>
	  <h5>RURAL  HOUSING: GENERAL</h5>
	  <p>Housing  in most rural areas is not seen as a problem in the short or medium term.</p>
	  <h5>ABSENTEE  LANDLORDS</h5>
	  <p>It is foreseen that absentee landlords could become a particularly  thorny political question. This paper proposes that a period of grace should be  given to permit owners to return to their properties and resume normal lives.  Should this fail other measures, such as added tax burdens and, ultimately,  governmental expropriation, should be considered. In the case of farmland  however, this must be linked to a wider policy of land redistribution and rural  food production.</p>
	  <h5>HOUSING  INFRASTRUCTURE AND TECHNOLOGY</h5>
	  <p>A programme of realistic low-income housing development will also  require extensive revision of existing municipal bye- laws, most particularly  those relating to housing standards, building densities, materials, building  lines and definitions of quality of workmanship. Infrastructural alternatives  relating to the reticulation of water, sewage, electricity and roads will also  have to be assessed in terms of local needs and affordability.</p>
	  <h5>LOW  INCOME OR POPULAR HOUSING</h5>
	  <p>A majority government will have to carefully evaluate its role and  degree of its participation in the provision of housing in the public sector.  Ultimately however, the delicate political nature of low-income housing, and  the generally exploitative practices of low-income housing practitioners, may  well ensure that overall control of this activity may have to remain in  government hands. As previously stated a policy capable of providing a wide  range of housing alternatives should be considered, having at its lowest level  the provision of a basic &quot;core house&quot; or &quot;roof first&quot;  structures as its most elemental units. Both are capable of finding application  in rural and urban areas.</p>
	  <h5>B.  SETTLEMENT</h5>
	  <h5>GENERAL  POLICY CONSIDERATIONS</h5>
	  <p>For the purposes of this paper I assume that the restrictions upon  black settlement placed by the Group Areas Act, the Gold Laws and similar  land-based enactments will be among the first to be repealed by a majority  government.</p>
	  <h5>INFRASTRUCTURAL  DEVELOPMENT IN INDEPENDENT &quot;HOMELANDS&quot;</h5>
	  <p>Despite the racist grounding and oppressive intent of current &quot;homeland&quot;  policy, one of its undeniable, and probably unintended, results is the creation  of an infrastructure in rural areas, and the fact that black citizens are now  receiving training in areas of employment normally closed to them elsewhere in South Africa. I  believe that by the time a majority government is in a position to assume power  in South Africa,  the so-called &quot;Independent Homelands&quot; will be able to make a  notable contribution to the administrative running of the country. Control of  the Civil Service and an ability to implement its policy decisions will be  vital to the political survival of the new government.</p>
	  <h5>RURAL  SETTLEMENT</h5>
	  <p>It is of paramount importance that any decisions made in regard  with rural settlement also be made in consultation with Agricultural Unions and  other food-producing bodies.</p>
	  <p>Where semi-urban conglomerations have arisen in rural areas as the  result of current (and illogical) separatist planning, their inhabitants should  be given the option of a State-assisted return to their previous homes.  Alternatively, where such settlements appear to have gained a measure of  permanence, the State should be instrumental in the establishment of  affirmative action programmes designed to promote the development of a social  and economic infrastructure, as well as the creation of job opportunities and  the eventual increase of community wealth.</p>
	  <p>The reduction of apartheid-generated rural settlements might also  be necessitated by the unwelcome expansion of population densities in such  areas. This would have the effect of placing undue stress upon already  overloaded or even non-existent physical infrastructures leading to health  problems and political destabilisation of the region. An alternative solution  might be the expropriation of adjoining farmlands held by absentee landlords  and made available for voluntary resettlement at nominal prices. It is  difficult however to assess the position of such impoverished areas as the  Eastern Province, the Northern Cape and parts of kwaZulu where resettlement programmes  beyond the scope of this paper should be envisaged.</p>
	  <p>I foresee that the redistribution of white-owned agricultural land  to black rural inhabitants will present a number of practical problems. On the  one hand, there will be a white political backlash to these proposals; on the  other the economic realities of black rural society may require that such a  program be coupled to parallel communal and cooperative State-subsidised  projects requiring a measure of centralised preplanning.</p>
	  <h5>URBAN  SETTLEMENT</h5>
	  <p>Urban settlement in this country is controlled by a number of laws  and regulations, many of them discriminatory in nature. These include municipal  bye-laws, conditions of title deed and the historical, if now-irrelevant,  rights of the township owner. Even assuming that a majority government will be  in a position to remove such restrictions, the effective control of proclaimed  urban and suburban land would still remain firmly in white hands. It is  expected that the emergence of a majority government will generate short-term  slump conditions in the property market. However these will be followed by a  rapid rise in property prices as whites move out of more affordable areas and  move into the suburbs. This means that most urban areas will retain their  predominantly racial and racist character; that the economic and residential  divisions currently existing between haves and have-nots will persist; and that  the use of market forces as a strategy to bring about racial integration will  meet with little success. This question is likely to be the subject of  considerable emotional responses among black and white alike and should be an  area of primary focus for a new government.</p>
	  <p>The problem will be simplified, to a degree, by the occurrence of  absentee landlords which should facilitate a policy of expropriation. However  it is expected that the amount of housing stock thus released for  government-controlled redistribution will be minimal. A majority government  will therefore be faced with a number of options. These include:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>the  subsidy of black families into white suburbs on a random basis. This should  have the effect of depressing existing property prices thus paving the way for  further black infiltration based upon more realistic property prices.</li>
	    <li>to  subsidise black families into white suburbs on an assessed educational and  economic basis. This would largely maintain property prices but create new  conditions of social inequality and reinforce existing ones.</li>
	    <li>to  consolidate expropriated properties into larger city blocks of integrated,  non-racial residences. Although this option presents some positive aspects,  these are offset by the danger that such areas might fail to achieve an  equitable racial mix, thus continuing present artificial divisions, if on a  smaller and more localized scale.</li>
	    </ul>
	  <h5>C.  GENERAL POLICY TOWARDS EXISTING BUILDING STOCK</h5>
	  <p>A degree of damage to state-owned public buildings, such as police  stations, post offices and military installations, should be expected during  the course of a soft option take-over.</p>
	  <h5>RENOVATION  AND REVALIDATION</h5>
	  <p>A number of existing buildings servicing the specialized needs and  ideological functions of the current regime, such as municipal liquor outlets,  &quot;Bantu&quot; Administration Boards and Population Register offices,  will have to undergo revalidation to meet the needs of a majority government.  This is a relatively high priority consideration.</p>
	  <h5>RESTORATION</h5>
	  <p>The programme of restoring and revalidating government buildings  of importance to the national cultural and architectural heritage will continue  to take place but will probably require a degree of redefinition of objectives.  Little deviation from present policies is expected.</p>
	  <h5>CONSERVATION  OF THE NATURAL AND BUILT ENVIRONMENT</h5>
	  <p>This will also involve larger issues such as the declaration of nature  parks, sensitive ecological areas, historical environments and national  monuments (dealt more fully below).</p>
	  <h5>RECONSTRUCTION</h5>
	  <p>This involves the gradual replacement of such building stock as  may be required due to low initial building standards (such as much of Soweto and other  government-built black suburbs) or such buildings of a cultural value as may  have become damaged accidentally in the course of conflict. Low priority.</p>
	  <h5>D.  GENERAL POLICY ON NATIONAL MONUMENTS</h5>
	  <p>Many national monuments have distinct emotional and political  connotations attached to their existence.&nbsp;  It is inevitable that, initially at least, a certain amount of vandalism  and desecration will take place. This should be viewed as a useful and necessary  safety valve.&nbsp; In the long run however  the soft option also must involve the reconciliation of all parties concerned  and the creation, and removal, of national monuments will be an important part  of such a process.</p>
	  <h5>EXISTING  NATIONAL MONUMENTS</h5>
	  <p>About 93% of all existing national monuments are aimed at  perpetuating the myth of white cultural superiority. Many are of a highly  emotive nature and some are even racist and hence offensive. These are not  expected to last beyond the first onslaught. Where similar symbols, such as the  Voortrekker Monument  in Pretoria, do  survive, their control and responsibility for their maintenance should be  passed onto interested parties at their own expense. Where there is no  response, then a policy of lassaire-faire should be allowed to prevail. This  means that such buildings should be allowed to crumble and collapse of their  own accord and through lack of popular interest. The symbolism of a ruined  monument to the old order should not be lost upon the new society which will  replace it.</p>
	  <h5>FUTURE  NATIONAL MONUMENTS</h5>
	  <p>It is important that our links to the past be maintained, in spite  of any hurtful colonial or political connotations they might have. The  maintenance and extension in the scope of present policy is urged.</p>
	  <h5>E.  GENERAL POLICIES AFFECTING THE ARCHITECTURAL PROFESSION</h5>
	  <p>The real and potential value of architectural skills to this  country should not be underestimated. This is in spite of the profession's  current image as the servant of racial elites and economic vested interests. It  is probable that once the nature of the client has changed, the responses of  the profession must follow suit.</p>
	  <h5>TERTIARY  ARCHITECTURAL EDUCATION</h5>
	  <p>A two-tier educational policy is proposed in our universities  based upon an extension of the current course being developed at the University of Cape Town. Ways must be found to open  architecture and make it more meaningful to the black community if it is to  survive as a learned profession and not as a group of qualified technicians.  South African architecture also has a long record of discriminating against  local indigenous aesthetics whilst retaining deep-seated links to developments  overseas. Programmes of primary, secondary as well as popular education must be  instituted.</p>
	  <h5>POSTSCRIPT</h5>
	  <p>This paper should have been delivered to a workshop organized by  the Study Group on Internal Relations, at Wits  University on Black Government in  South Africa: The Promise of the Future, Johannesburg,  20 November 1982. Predictably, its subject did not meet with the approval of  the apartheid government, and after its organizers came under pressure from the  South African Security Police, it was cancelled it at the last moment. Despite  some very real temptations to make cosmetic alterations in order to bring it up  to date, I have decided to retain it in its original format as a record of its  times.</p>
