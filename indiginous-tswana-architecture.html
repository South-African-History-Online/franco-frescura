        <h5 align="left">AN INTRODUCTION TO TSWANA ARCHITECTURE</h5>
        <p align="left">Franco Frescura</p>
        <h5>PREAMBLE</h5>
        <p>Since 1753, when Marc-Antoine Laugier  proclaimed that All the splendors of architecture ever conceived have been  modelled on the little rustic hut (1977: 12), our understanding of vernacular  architecture has been subjected to a variety of theories and ideologies which,  like Laugier, have sought to explain its &quot;fixed and unchangeable laws&quot;.  Most early works were guided by a strong cultural and environmental  predeterminism which, like Viollet-le-Duc (1876), were often coloured by the  romantic idea that such environments were built by Rousseau's &quot;noble  savages&quot; (1959). More recently, writers such as Rapoport (1969, 1977,  1982), Hall (1973) and Marc (1977) have discounted such theories and have  postulated that human environment is the product of a wider cognitive language  deeply rooted in cultural cosmology.</p>
        <p>Regardless of their philosophical content,  all such works have two major factors in common. Firstly, they are the  construct of Western intellectuals who, taking a number of isolated case  studies, usually drawn at second or third hand, have sought to formulate &quot;universal  truths&quot; on the subject. It is then left for their acolytes and  faithful followers to go forth and validate these &quot;truths&quot; by  &quot;discovering&quot; supporting data in the field. Secondly, the  people most concerned with these theories, the builders of vernacular  architecture themselves, have little or no say in their formulation. They are  still regarded as the &quot;noble savages&quot; who provide the grist to  the intellectual mill and it is questionable whether they could ever recognise  their own work, once processed and sanitised, for the consumption of a  predominantly European and North American public.</p>
        <p>Thus any essay which sets out to discuss  the vernacular architecture of a people in terms of a pre-stated ideological  stance ceases to be a discussion about that architecture and, by definition,  becomes a discussion about the writer's ideology. Worse still, any response by  outsiders to this debate can only be made in terms of other ideologies, thus  becoming a debate between ideologies, not about architecture.</p>
        <p>This paper sets out to discuss the  vernacular architecture of the Tswana. Much of its data is based upon the  historical accounts of nineteenth century travelers and early twentieth century  anthropologists and is therefore the product of European and colonial observers  whose objectivity was often coloured by a variety of cultural, religious and  political prejudices. Therefore the first and major task of this essay was to  bring together these historical sources, most of which are already well known  individually, and present them as architectural accounts unencumbered by  colonial ideology and jargon. This was done by re-interpreting them in terms of  current field work conducted amongst the descendants of those groups visited by  white travelers nearly two centuries ago. Where contemporary information is  given, this is done in order to give the architecture concerned a sense of  continuity and transition and not to reinforce any current social or political  stereotypes which may have developed in the intervening years. Although the  writings of many early and contemporary theorists have been taken into account,  their work serves as a background to this paper and its research does not set  out to justify any particular philosophy. Where such terminology as &quot;left  and right&quot; has been used in the context of settlement patterns, this  has not been done as a reference to Adam Kuper's structuralist writings (1980)  but because this concept is used currently by many rural inhabitants of  southern Africa to explain their own habitat and inheritance laws (Seymour,  1982).</p>
        <h5>HISTORICAL BACKGROUND</h5>
        <p>It is probable that the term &quot;Tswana&quot;  dates its origins from the early years of the nineteenth century when it was  used by white visitors to southern Africa, such as Dundas (Barrow, 1801 and  1804: 114-116) and Lichtenstein (1812 and 1815: 2: 373-379), as a collective  noun to describe those indigenous groups inhabiting the region's hinterland.  Although more recent times have witnessed the development of a &quot;Tswana&quot;  state, the name should be seen originally to have represented a cultural  identity rather than a political unity. Indeed the history of the Tswana is  characterised by a series of internal schisms giving rise to a number of  independent chiefdoms. Among the most important of these were the Kwena, the  Hurutshe, the Kgatla, the Tlhaping, the Ngwato and the Rolong. The development  of separate Pedi and southern Sotho identities subsequent to the Difaqane of  1822-1836, a period of widespread social upheaval and economic hardship  throughout central southern Africa, should  also be viewed in terms of this fissionary trend (Maylam, 1986: 54-63).</p>
        <p>Although these groups are known to have  originally inhabited parts of the present-day northern Cape, the central-southern Transvaal and the northern OFS, as a result of the  Difaqane many moved westwards and their descendants may be currently found in  the western Transvaal, the northern Cape and Botswana. A small group of Rolong,  which is also identified with the larger Tswana polity, moved south in 1833 and  settled in the Thaba 'Nchu area of the OFS (Omer-Cooper, 1978). (figure 1)</p>
        <h5>PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT</h5>
        <p>Generally speaking those areas currently inhabited  by the Tswana lie in the highveld and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. They are typified by warm rainy summers and cool  dry winters, with large diurnal temperature ranges and periodic droughts  increasing in severity as one moves westward (Cole, 1961: 64-92). These  conditions are inimical to tree growth and the region may be termed a true  grassland, an open savannah with an admixture of thorny acacia trees and bushes  (Acocks, 1975). When Campbell  visited the northern Cape  in 1820 he stated that he &quot;.<em>.. entered upon another extensive plain,  also without tree or bush, and which seemed to be only bounded by the  horizon.</em>&quot; (1822: 1: 152)</p>
        <p>A measure of timber, mostly acacia, could,  at one time, be found growing further to the north and east towards the Harts  valley, but the development of a diamond mining industry in and about Kimberley  during the 1870's had the practical effect of deforestating this area. It has  been estimated that during this era the Diamond Fields were consuming an  average of one wagon-load of firewood per white family every month  (Shillington, 1985: 66-68). The exhaustion of such natural resources was to  have important repercussions in later years upon the folk architecture of the  region for, like rural builders elsewhere in southern Africa, the Tswana rely  upon their natural environment as a quarry for their building materials.  Writing in 1805, Lichtenstein reported that:</p>
        <p>&quot;<em>A Beetjuan tribe always fix their  abode in the midst of a wood of mimosas, the stems of these trees, where they  grow to a considerable height, being one of the most essential articles in  building their houses. Twelve or fourteen of these stems are requisite to build  a good house; eight or ten of these must be nine foot high, the rest three or  four feet higher.</em>&quot; (Lichtenstein,  1812 and 1815: 2: 373-379)</p>
        <p>Yet it would be wrong to describe the  architecture of the Tswana as a series of responses to their physical  environment. It is true that an availability of natural building materials and  prevailing climatic conditions are important limiting factors in the creation  of a folk architecture anywhere, and the dwellings of the Tswana are prime  examples of how a community has adapted the grass, the clay, the wood and the  stones about it to create dwellings which are at once cheap, durable and  attractive. However an analysis of the forms, textures and decorations of the  individual dwelling unit reveals that the built environment of the Tswana is a  reflection of the cultural values, sexual mores, social hierarchies, religious  beliefs and cosmological norms of the people as a whole. It is a habitat which  is subject to a series of patterns, rules and constraints which, once its  language has been learned and understood, gains in substance and significance  and demands from the visitor recognition as an architecture in its own right.</p>
        <h5>HISTORY OF THE TSWANA DWELLING BEFORE 1820</h5>
        <p>It is not easy to piece together a  detailed picture of the architecture of southern Africa  before 1820. Because of the nature of the structures concerned, very little  direct knowledge of indigenous architectural forms and building technologies  has come down to the present day and much of what we do know is the direct  result of archaeological reconstruction and the interpolation of data. It is  fortunate that the architect, like the historian, is able to draw upon the  richness of local oral and folk traditions to a large extent and although much  of this information is open to interpretation, part of it may be shown to be  historically valid.</p>
        <p>A wide range of dwelling forms is known to  have been built in the southern African hinterland before the years of  Difaqane. However, as one would expect from so large an area, their spread was  by no means homogeneous, and if present-day evidence is anything to go by, the  region probably supported a number of different building technologies.</p>
        <p>The earliest evidence found, to date, of a  Tswana architectural tradition was uncovered by Mason at his Broederstroom  site. There he excavated hut floors some 3,000m in diameter which have been  dated at about 450 CE (1974; 1981: 401-416). As at most other proto-Tswana  archaeological sites, the dwellings are thought to have been in the form of a  cone on cylinder with verandah running about their perimeter. More conclusive,  if later, data of cone on cylinder and full verandah structures have been found  by Maggs in the northern Orange Free State, dated at 1550 CE (1976: 238-239);  by Mason at Olifantspoort, dated at 1600 CE (1974; 1981: 401-416); and by  Taylor at two separate sites, at Buffelshoek near Parys and at Suikerbosrand  near Heidelberg, both being dated at about 1700 CE (1979). (figure 2)</p>
        <p>The picture being presented to date by  archaeologists of the early architecture of this region is therefore somewhat  incomplete. Fortunately from 1801 onwards this meagre data is supplemented  extensively by the accounts of early travellers to southern Africa.  Men like Truter, Lichtenstein, Burchell, Campbell, Backhouse and, later, Holub  all traveled among the Tswana extensively and their reports tend to confirm the  findings of current archaeological researches. They also described an  architectural tradition which, to European eyes, was both exciting and unique.  When Burchell arrived at Dithakong, the Tlhaping capital in the northern Cape located  near present-day Kuruman, in 1812, he was met with:</p>
        <p>&quot;... <em>the most gratifying sight which  my journey had yet afforded, presented itself; and part of the Town of Litakun now appeared  before me.&nbsp; As we advanced nearer, and  gained higher ground, the multitude of houses which continued rising into view  as far as I could see, excited astonishment; while their novel form and  character seized my whole attention.</em>&quot; (1953: 254-256)</p>
        <p>Although these early visitors generally  limited their travels to the more populated areas of the northern Cape, eastern Botswana and  the western Transvaal, the picture they  presented did not differ in substance from that described by twentieth century  archaeologists. The Dundas  report of 1801 stated that:</p>
        <p>&quot;...<em> (the chiefs) house, like all the  rest in the town, was built in a circular form, being about sixteen feet in  diameter. The bottom part, to the height of four feet from the ground, was  stone laid in clay, and wooden spars erected at certain distances. On the east  side of the circle, about the fourth part of the house was open, the other  three-fourths entirely closed. A round pointed roof covered the whole in the  form of a tent, well thatched with long reeds, or with the straws of the  holcus. From the centre to the back part of the house, a circular apartment is  made off, with a narrow entrance into it, where the head of the family takes  his nightly rest; the other members of the family sleep in the fore- part, or  between the large and small circles of the house. All of the houses were  enclosed by pallisades; and the space between these and the dwelling serves for  a granary and store for their grain and pulse. These granaries were constructed  in the form of oil jars, of baked clay, ... and they were supported on tripods,  composed of the same material, which raised them about nine inches off the  ground. They were covered with a round straw roof erected on poles</em>&quot; (Barrow, 1801 and 1804: 114-116)</p>
        <p>The drawings of Daniell, probably  originating from the same expedition, aptly illustrate these points (1820).  Subsequent travelers to the region were all in agreement with the Dundas report, describing  the Tswana to be residing in cone on cylinder dwellings, surrounded by circular  verandahs which at times were quite substantial, and may or may not have been partly  enclosed to give a number of storage or sleeping chambers about a central drum  (figure 3). Most homesteads appeared to follow a &quot;bilobial&quot;  pattern, being two courtyards, or &quot;lobes&quot;, created by means of  walls or screens, and set about a central dwelling unit (figure 4). The fore-  court was usually associated with the family's semi-public or leisure functions  whilst the rear court served as a work and cooking area. This is a settlement  pattern which has become particularly identified with the architecture of the  Sotho/Tswana on the highveld (Maggs, 1976) and which, in a slightly modified  form, has been transmitted through to the present day.</p>
        <p>Most accounts also made many valuable  comments about local building technology and wall decorations. Lichtenstein,  writing in 1805 (1812 and 1815: 2: 373), told us that the drum wall was stopped  short of the timber roof structure, a detail which we now know to be a measure  against termite spread into the thatch.</p>
        <p>The first accounts of Tswana wall  decoration also date from this time. Burchell visited the Tlhaping homestead of  &quot;Serrakutu&quot; at Dithakong in 1812 and recorded that this man's  younger wife:</p>
        <p>&quot;.<em>.. exhibited her paintings in a  manner which evinced that she was well satisfied with her own performance. They  were, the figures of several animals, rudely drawn, with a paint of white  earth, against the front-wall of the house.</em>&quot; (1953: 321-322)</p>
        <p>A year later Campbell visited the same homestead and &quot;...  found them very rough representations of the camel leopard (giraffe),  rhinoceros, elephant, lion, tiger and stein-buck, which Salakootoo's wife had  drawn on the clay wall with white and black paint.&quot; (1815: 194)</p>
        <p>Then, as now, this work appears to have  been the province   of Twana women.  Regrettably both Burchell and Campbell failed to reproduce in their work more  accurate graphic illustrations of such wall decorations, an omission which was  rectified by Campbell seven years later when he visited the Hurutshe town of  Kaditshwene, located immediately to the north of present-day Zeerust. There he  visited the local chief's homestead and found that:</p>
        <p>&quot;<em>Sinosee's house was neatly finished;  it was circular like all the others, having not only the wall plastered both  within and without, but likewise the inside of the roof. The wall was painted  yellow and ornamented with figures of shields, elephants, cameleopards, etc. It  was also adorned with a neat cornice or border painted of a red colour</em>.&quot; (1822: 1: 227-228)</p>
        <p>He also pointed out that the houses of  Kadidtshwene were &quot;.<em>.. plastered on the outside and painted yellow. One  we observed painted red and yellow with some taste</em>.&quot; (1822: 1:  222-224)</p>
        <p>These travelers also gave details of other  types of structures found in this region which, because of the nature of their  technology, are not likely to have left many traces behind for modern-day  archaeologists to excavate. The residents of Dithakong, for example, were  recorded by Burchell in 1812 to have built temporary huts at a few days' travel  from their town to serve as a winter cattle grazing station (1953: 360-372). Campbell, in 1820, noted  the use of huts raised on stilts, as well as the more conventional verandah  cone on cylinder dwellings, among the Hurutshe of Kaditshwene. That same year  he also visited Maribogo, in the northern    Cape, where the Thamaga, a Kgalagadi and hence  predominantly Tswana group, were building hemispherical structures, covered  with matting in the Khoikhoi style but using some form of extended entrance  (1822: 1: 279). (figure 5)</p>
        <p>One structure which may provide a valuable  insight into the processes of Tswana architecture during the early nineteenth  century, but which has gone unremarked until comparatively recent times, was  depicted by Daniell in or near Dithakong in about 1801. It is entitled &quot;A  Boosh-Wannah Hut&quot; and shows what can be positively identified as a  hemispherical structure surmounted by a conical roof carried by a series of  verandah posts (1820) (figures 6 and 7). Similar structures were subsequently  described by Burchell at Dithakong in 1812 where he found that some Tlhaping  dwellings:</p>
        <p>&quot;...<em> have a small inner apartment  which occupies the centre of the building ... intended as the bed-room for the  parents while the outer apartment is for the children. This inner or central  apartment is frequently built in the shape of a cone, or a half-ellipsis, the  point of which reaches to the height of the roof which it serves to support and  strengthen. In other instances ... its form is cylindrical;&nbsp; and this appeared to be an improved  construction</em>.&quot;  (1953: 360-372)</p>
        <p>Sanderson, writing subsequently in 1858-9,  described a dwelling of similar construction among the Pugeni, in the  Magaliesberg. He said that:</p>
        <p>&quot;<em>Every hut or house is divided from  the others by a fence or wall, and is surrounded by a broad eaves or verandah.  The hut itself is circular, built of stone plastered over with clay, and in the  better class polished inside and out with beeswax. The roof is thatched with  straw or reeds, conical, and 20 or 30 feet in height. The courtyards  surrounding the huts are plastered, and kept scrupulously clean. The front half  of the veranda is usually enclosed with a dwarf wall, and the semicircular  doorway, 18 or 20 inches in height, closed by a board sliding behind a couple  of pilasters forming a frame. Opposite the door inside, and extending a third  of the way round, is a platform or dais raised about 6 inches, in which are  sometimes planted the stems of one or two small trees, the branches of which  serve to hang articles upon. The inside of the hut is in the middle, about 6 feet  high, oval in section, and without light or ventilation, except from the  doorway</em>.&quot; (1860:  233-255)</p>
        <p>It becomes clear therefore that the  dwelling drawn by Daniell represented a structure such as those described by  both Burchell and Sanderson, but in a state of incompletion. In this context  also it becomes clear that the strange painted structure drawn by Campbell at  Kaditshwene in 1820 was no more than a decorated inner chamber belonging to the  Hurutshe chief (figure 8).</p>
        <p>A further group of indigenous structures  whose status is the subject of some debate are the corbelled stone huts found  in the northern Orange Free State and some parts of the southern Transvaal.  These shelters are a feature of early Iron Age settlements whose construction  was originally attributed, up to comparatively recent times, to an indigenous  group called the &quot;Lekoya&quot; or &quot;Ghoya&quot; (Walton,  1965). Early White travellers to the region first recorded their existence, but  found them mostly uninhabited as a result of the Difaqane. Lord and Baines  described their construction as follows:</p>
        <p>&quot;<em>A circle of blocks is laid on the  ground, then another on them, with the edges projecting a little inward, so  that the circumference of each course is less than that of the one immediately  beneath it; a large slab covers the top and finishes the building.</em>&quot; (1976: 246-250) (figure 9)</p>
        <p>Recent archaeological research has  attributed their construction to either the Taung or the Kubung, both being  Sotho groups who inhabited this region up to the time of Difaqane. Maggs has  linked their building to that of both his Type V and, on a few occasions, Type  Z settlements, thus dating them to the early sixteenth century (1976).  Corbelled stone structures were generally built to such a small scale that it  is difficult to conceive of them as adults' dwellings. This, and the fact that  such shelters were often incorporated into the walling of cattle byres leads us  to the conclusion that their function was to act as herdboys' huts. This  supposition is supported by Walton, whose photographs of herdboys' huts in Lesotho show  structures very similar in nature and intent to the corbelled stone shelters of  the highveld (1956: 133).</p>
        <h5>TSWANA ARCHITECTURE DURING THE DIFAQANE</h5>
        <p>The Sotho/Tswana word &quot;difaqane&quot;,  or to give it is Nguni equivalent &quot;mfecane&quot;, means, literally,  &quot;the scattering of the people&quot; (Wilson and Thompson, 1975: 1:  391). It has come to signify a period in southern African history between 1822  and 1836 when the major part of the sub-continent entered a period of upheaval and  turmoil which transformed the whole nature of rural pre-industrial society and  paved the way for changes in the region's economy and system of government.</p>
        <p>General opinion among historians has  attributed the beginnings of the Difaqane to the emergence of a Northern Nguni  state under the leadership of one ambitious and charismatic leader  (Omer-Cooper, 1978). Although outwardly true, it is also probable that the rise  of a Zulu kingdom was also precipitated by a need on the part of southern  African rural society to meet, in the foreseeable future, the increasing  demands for land being made by White settlers to the south. This would explain  why the Zulu Royal Court  persisted, right up to 1879, in treating the British as allies and the Dutch as  potential enemies. It would also explain how groups from Sotho, Tswana and  Nguni language backgrounds were able to coalesce into the centralised state of  the Basotho in order to resist, with a high degree of success, the incursions  of Zulu, British and Dutch upon their settlements. Certainly the resultant  massive population shifts, the concentration of people into some areas and the  depopulation of others was to set the pattern for the future growth of the  modern states of southern Africa as well as  provide the inception of many of its later problems.</p>
        <p>The period of Difaqane, far from being an  isolated event in the history of the indigenous people of southern Africa, was in many ways also interlinked with parallel  events in the sub-continent's White immigrant community. Although scattered  missionary infiltration had begun some time before, it was given considerable  impetus by the publication of Campbell's  accounts of his travels through the region during 1812-13 and again in 1820  (1822). As a result, missionary activity in southern Africa  increased rapidly between 1822 and 1836, most particularly in the northern Cape, the Eastern Cape and Lesotho, all  three areas being the backdrop for some of the most momentous events of this  era. This period was also to witness an increasing British military  involvement; the introduction of immigrant British farmers into the Eastern Cape; the  extension of a trading infrastructure into the southern African hinterland; and  finally the northward migration of itinerant Dutch farmers and pastoralists  from the Cape. All four groups, missionaries,  military, traders and farmers, were to have a powerful influence upon the  subsequent history, and hence the architecture, of rural southern Africa.</p>
        <p>The descriptions of Tswana architecture  which have come down to us from this time differ little from what we already  know of the region. Many of the patterns outlined previously are now confirmed  and brought into greater focus and the first signs of an infiltration by  foreign dwelling forms and building technologies are now perceived to occur.  However owing to the events of the Difaqane, there is a noticeable shift in  population patterns away from the central highveld and the cores of what were  subsequently to become known as the Tswana, the south Sotho and the Pedi  groupings become apparent during this time.</p>
        <p>It is probable that during this period the  region's historic style of dwelling construction, the cone on cylinder, was  maintained unaltered, reports of such structures being made by Burrow at  Dithakong in 1835 (1971: 35), Backhouse at Motito in 1839 (1844) (figure 10)  and Smith at Motito and Mothibi in 1835 (1975: 195), all of the above being  located in the northern Cape.</p>
        <p>Tswana cone on cylinder dwellings were  also noted by Smith at Bethulie in 1834 (1975: 38), a report which was  confirmed by Backhouse five years later (1844: 354-355); and Casalis recorded  structures of an apparently similar nature in 1836 at Makossane (1861: 143)  (figure 11). The first observations concerning the Pedi of the central-northern  Transvaal were also made at this time by Smith  in 1835 (1975: 245) and Arbousset and Daumas in about 1836 (1846: 273-274).  Both recorded the use of circular plan verandah dwellings, thus confirming the  archaeological and historical evidence of previous eras (figure 12).</p>
        <p>An interesting building tradition which  appears to have existed in the region during this time, alongside the more  conventional cone on cylinder, was that of the Hurutshe of the western Transvaal who raised their dwellings above ground level  by means of a series of stilts. This practice was first reported by Campbell when he visited  Kaditshwene in 1820 and was confirmed subsequently by both Smith (1975: 195)  (figure 13) and Burrow in 1835 when they visited the Hurutshe in the &quot;Kashane&quot;  mountains, the present-day Magaliesberge. Burrow stated that:</p>
        <p>&quot;<em>Some of the inhabitants of this part  live in houses perched on the tops of poles, to protect them, I suppose, from  the Lions ... These pole-houses are all enclosed in a kraal like the others, but  they never come down if they can avoid it at night, as the Lion will sometimes  lie in wait the whole night ...</em>&quot; (1971: 53-55)</p>
        <p>A &quot;structure&quot; having  similar intent but of a somewhat different form was recorded by the traders  Schoon and M'Luckie in 1829 at Kaditshwene (figure 14). They went one better  than their predecessors when they claimed to have found:</p>
        <p>&quot;... <em>a large tree containing  seventeen conical huts. These are used as dormitories, being beyond the reach  of the lions, which, ... have become very numerous in the neighbourhood and  destructive to human life. The branches of these trees are supported by forked  sticks or poles, and there are three tiers or platforms on which the huts are  constructed. The lowest is nine feet from the ground, and holds ten huts, the  second about eight feet high, has three huts, and the upper storey, if it may  be so called, contains four. The ascent to these is made by notches cut in the  supporting poles, and the huts are built with twigs thatched with straw, and  will contain two persons conveniently.</em>&quot; (Steedman, 1835)</p>
        <p>The validity and common sense of such  structures is difficult to establish. Stilt architecture elsewhere in the world  has usually been associated, in the past, with low-lying marshy lands, a  condition which can hardly be said to have prevailed in the semi-arid regions  inhabited by the Hurutshe. All of the travelers quoted above were in agreement  that such architecture was the direct result of lions hunting in these parts,  terrorising the local population. However these predators do not seem to have  presented undue terrors for the Hurutshe's neighbours nor, for that matter, for  the rest of southern Africa. Hence the  existence of such a building tradition must be regarded as a curious enigma in  the history of indigenous architecture.</p>
        <p>An interesting development dating from  this era is the early introduction of immigrant building forms and technologies  into this region. The first such example was recorded in June 1820 when Campbell visited the  homestead of Seretse at Phatwane, in the northern    Cape. There he recounted that:</p>
        <p>&quot;<em>We ... visited ... his house, which  is built in the fashion of the country; but he has one behind constructed after  the European manner, having taken the plan of it from those of the Missionaries  that he had seen at Lattakoo (Dithakong). I made him a present of two saws, two  chissels and four gimlets. Never did a hungry man receive food with more  avidity than Seretz received these tools.</em>&quot; (1822: 2: 81-82)</p>
        <p>The exact form taken by this dwelling built  &quot;after the European manner&quot; has not come down to us but it may  be assumed that it was a rectangular plan structure, single or two cell,  probably gabled at either end. It is also not known whether it was the result  of indigenous effort or, as in other contemporary cases elsewhere in southern Africa, the work of some itinerant European builder.  However it should be noted that although square plan dwellings begin to appear  in Tswana architecture henceforth with increasing frequency, their use was  generally limited to their leadership, principally their chiefs and the  headmen. The adoption of immigrant building forms and technologies did not  become more widespread until over one century later.</p>
        <h5>THE TSWANA DWELLING DURING THE COLONIAL ERA</h5>
        <p>When viewed from an architectural  standpoint, the years between 1840 and 1925 were to prove an important period  in the history not only of this region but of southern Africa  as a whole. It was made notable not so much by any direct developments which  may have occurred in this field, as by events of a political and economic  nature which, with the passing of time, were to exert an increasingly powerful  influence upon local building traditions.</p>
        <p>The political stage was set by the defeat  and subsequent emigration of Mzilikazi's Matabele to Zimbabwe early in 1837. This may  finally have brought to an end fifteen years of turmoil on the highveld, but it  also created a power vacuum which White immigrants were not slow in filling. At  first this was limited to migrant Dutch farmers but, with the discoveries of  diamonds in the northern Cape  in 1866 and of gold in the Transvaal in the  1870s, an international flood of miners, land speculators, fortune seekers and  assorted camp followers were also attracted to the region. The resultant internal  tensions between Black and White, as well as between White and White, were to  manifest themselves in periods of sporadic violence which had the larger effect  of slowly dispossessing more and more indigenous groups of the land they had  occupied for centuries.</p>
        <p>The establishment of primary industries in  the southern African interior was to have some important effects upon its  social and physical environment.</p>
        <ol type="a">
          <li>It  created areas of urbanisation which continue to provide, to the present day,  opportunities for cross-cultural contact and mixing. The beginnings of a  breakdown in historical patterns of rural culture throughout southern Africa can be traced back to this period.</li>
          <li>It  created centres of industrial development which were to bring into the region  new technologies and materials. With time, these were to filter through into  the rural areas.</li>
          <li>These  centres of industrial development also effectively plundered the surrounding  countryside of much of its timber resources thus forcing Tswana architecture  away from its historical technologies and building forms.</li>
          <li>It  created a demand for labour which, at its onset, was only partly met by local  communities. The political subjugation of Black rural groups, the subsequent  imposition of hut taxes and the creation of markets for consumer goods in the  rural areas were to provide the stimulus which was ultimately to turn rural  southern Africa into one vast pool of migrant  labour (figure 15).</li>
          <li>It  created markets for the sale of surplus rural food production. Initially this  was predominantly in the hands of Black farmers but, with the imbalanced  development of a support infrastructure in White rural areas after 1925, this  position was to change considerably. Important factors after this date which  should also be considered are the curtailment of Black land ownership and the  increasing impoverishment of formerly fertile Black rural lands through  overgrazing, subsistence farming and overpopulation.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>It is obvious that the factors listed  above present only a limited view of early urbanisation on the southern African  highveld. Other important elements of a socio-political nature do exist but  largely tend to fall outside the scope of an architectural study such as this.</p>
        <p>Accounts of Tswana architecture made by  White immigrants and travelers to the region during this era confirm the  general picture gained up to and including the Difaqane (figure 16). The  dominant dwelling form, the cone on cylinder, often surrounded by a circular  verandah about its perimeter, survived through this period and well into the  twentieth century with relatively few changes. Such dwellings were recorded by  Baines near the Ki-Gariep or Vaal river in  1850 (1961 and 1964: 180-181), by Holub in the northern Cape, western Transvaal  and eastern Botswana  in 1873-77 (1881: 1: 372)(figure 17), by Wangemann at Thaba 'Nchu in 1867  (1871-75: 1: 89), and by Merensky at Sekhukhuni's capital in 1882 (1875:  84-86). Ordinary cone on cylinder structures were also recorded by Holub at Kimberley and among the  Rolong in the western Transvaal, both in 1873  (1881: 1: 409).</p>
        <p>Further evidence of a Tswana tradition in  wall decoration was recorded by Baines, when he visited a homestead on the Vaal River  in December 1850. He told how the courtyard walls were:</p>
        <p>&quot;...<em> of mud about six feet high, also  circular, nicely levelled and polished, more particularly on the inside, where  it was fantastically marked off into square, triangles and diamonds, marked  either by straight or waved lines in light drab clay upon a darker  ground</em>.&quot; (1961  and 1964: 180-181)</p>
        <p>The introduction to this region of the  flat-roofed, square plan dwellings, more commonly known today as the &quot;highveld&quot;  or &quot;parapet&quot; house, can probably also be dated to this period.  This is a dwelling form which, over the past two centuries, has been identified  with a variety of urban as well as rural environments. Its origins may be  traced back to Cape Town  as early as 1717 (Dennis Radford, pers comm) but by the end of the eighteenth  century its use had become associated with the local Malay community.  Originally this consisted of a central doorway giving onto a living/cooking  area with a sleeping room located to one side of it. Windows were set equally  about the door opening giving the front facade a symmetry which suggested a  balanced disposition of plan which was seldom retained. The door and window  reveals were often emphasized with broad plaster surrounds as were the fa&ccedil;ade  corners. The parapet walls rose on three sides of the low-pitch roof allowing  rainwater drainage to occur to the rear and away from the facade. The front  parapet was often corniced although in some examples the plaster mouldings were  heavily ornamented (Lewcock, 1963).</p>
        <p>The flat-roofed dwelling was soon found to  be highly suited to the semi-arid conditions of the southern African interior  and during the nineteenth century its use spread to the towns and farms of the Karoo. Subsequently, as Dutch farmers emigrated into the  OFS and Transvaal regions, they took the  knowledge of this architectural form with them, leading Holub to remark in 1873  that:</p>
        <p>&quot;<em>In its general aspect Fauresmith is  very like the other Towns in the Free    State ... and the clean, white-washed residences,  flat roofed as elsewhere ... looked altogether pleasant enough.</em>&quot; (1881: 1: 43)</p>
        <p>Despite the availability of corrugated  iron sheeting in the southern African interior from the 1870s onwards, the  construction of flat-roofed dwellings was slow to spread into indigenous Tswana  architecture. There is sufficient evidence to show that, outside of certain  urban areas, this domestic form did not meet with immediate acceptance and it  is probable that its use in rural areas did not occur much before the 1940s.</p>
        <h5>TRANSITION AND CHANGE IN TSWANA ARCHITECTURE</h5>
        <p>Previous discussion has shown how, from  1866 onwards, the development of major urban and industrial centres in the  southern African hinterland had major repercussions upon the cultural and  environmental fabric of rural Tswana society. Their impact was aggravated by a  general deforestation of the region and a prolonged period of drought which was  followed successively by plagues of locusts, the rinderpest epidemic of  1897 and the South African conflict of 1899-1902. As a result, architectural  traditions of the region were forced to undergo a number of adaptations,  usually involving the application of new building forms, materials and  technologies. Amongst others, these included:</p>
        <ol type="a">
          <li>The  introduction of rectangular and square plan dwellings. Despite the implication  that these represent an obvious example of cross-cultural borrowing between  immigrant Whites and indigenous Blacks, the development of such architecture  must be seen in the context of a growing cash economy among the rural Tswana.  This made available to them a wide range of mass-produced artifacts, including  furniture, which, being based upon a right-angle geometry, made their inclusion  in circular living spaces difficult and inefficient. It should also be borne in  mind that most Tswana homesteads currently still include circular as well as  square plan dwellings. The latter therefore should not be perceived as  supplanting older and more traditional Tswana domestic forms but rather as  supplementing and enriching their range of architectural expression.</li>
          <li>The  introduction of a sun-dried or &quot;green&quot; brick technology, more  commonly known throughout southern Africa as  &quot;Kimmerli&quot; or &quot;Kimberley&quot;  bricks. As indicated by their name, these probably originated in the 1870s in  the diamond fields where a lack of infrastructure made the large-scale  transport of such building materials from the coastal areas uneconomical.  However it must also be pointed out that the Tswana already had a brick  technology of their own in existence before Whites ever reached the highveld.  The Tswana brick, called &quot;polwane&quot; differed from the European  &quot;green&quot; brick, locally referred to as &quot;ditena&quot;  (from the Afrikaans &quot;steen&quot;), in that it was smaller, flatter  and made by hand.</li>
          <li>The  replacement of the Tswana's historical timber-orientated wall building  technology with one using sun-dried bricks. This was forced upon local builders  through the depletion of the region's already meager timber resources.</li>
          <li>The  breakdown of historical Tswana roof thatching technologies. This was one of the  unforeseen results of a series of land acts enacted in South Africa  during the 1920s and 1930s which limited the ownership and settlement of the  Tswana upon prescribed reserves. With subsequent population expansion many of  these areas became overcrowded and overgrazed, thus increasing the competition  already existing between rural communities and their cattle for an already  limited resource.</li>
          <li>The  depletion of natural building resources, timber and grass, which at one time  had been freely available from the environment about them, forced the Tswana to  seek out alternative sources of materials. This need was partly met by the  availability, from the 1870s onwards, of corrugated iron sheeting. Although  this material was initially expensive and limited in use to the urban areas,  with time it also began to percolate through to the rural countryside. The  introduction of corrugated iron as a roofing medium also had the effect of  forcing a change of floor plan upon Tswana builders. An introduction of square  plan dwellings should therefore also be seen as an environmental response quite  divorced from the idea that it was the result of direct borrowing from an  immigrant European culture.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Although missionaries had been urging  changes upon the architecture of the Tswana from as early as the 1820s, the  side-effects of industrial development did not begin to manifest themselves  upon the countryside, until well into the twentieth century. The records of  Duggan-Cronin, who traveled widely among the Tswana in the 1920s, fail to show  much western impact upon local building customs up to that point in time (1929).  It is probable that what changes have since been wrought in their built  environment, only began to take overt form from the 1940s and 1950s onwards.  Even so, a survey of most Tswana towns will show that historical building forms  and techniques are still predominant over foreign influences.</p>
        <h5>CONTEMPORARY TSWANA DOMESTIC ARCHITECTURE</h5>
        <p>Despite the fact that the Tswana have, for  the past nine generations, been presented with powerful incentives to change  the nature of their dwelling forms and building technologies, they have  remained steadfast in their attachment to the aesthetics and techniques of  previous pre-colonial eras. Where modern materials have been adopted or new  forms devised, these have been incorporated into the built environment without  abandoning the essential character of Tswana rural architecture. Today their  homes bear a distinct regional identity which proclaims their origins just as  visibly as if they were to attach banners to them.</p>
        <p>It is true that, since they were visited  by Daniell in 1801, some Tswana dwelling forms have been abandoned or have  become archaic. This is most particularly true of the verandah cone on cylinder  which may still be widely found in Botswana, but of which only  scattered examples are still being built in parts of South Africa. Its construction  however varies little from earlier times. In the western Transvaal  and northern Cape  a series of timber posts or columns some 2,100 m high are set in a circle and  support a timber ring beam which, in its turn, carries the conical roof  structure, battered and thatched with the grass bundles laid seed-end upwards.  hatching takes place from the eaves upwards. The wall is constructed in  monolithic earth or sun-dried brick plastered over with &quot;daka&quot;,  a mixture of clay and cow dung, and usually stands 600mm to 1,000m within the  external perimeter of posts, thus providing the dwelling with a verandah  (figure 18). In Botswana  construction is similar but eaves are often lower and verandahs deeper thus  allowing a number of domestic function to take place beneath them. Thatching in  Botswana  also appears to follow an older tradition: the thatch is not sewn down  (referred to as the &quot;Boer&quot; style in South Africa) but is held down by  means of an overlaid network of grass ropes. In all cases the inner drum or  sanctuary appears to have been dispensed with altogether, although many  examples were noted where the circular living chamber was partitioned into two  or even three compartments.</p>
        <p>Several variations on the theme of the  verandah cone on cylinder were recorded in the northern Cape. In the region immediately  west of Mafikeng several examples were noted  where the circular plan was retained except for the frontage of the dwelling  which had been &quot;flattened&quot; at the doorway. Another, at Genesa,  had been similarly treated but the room had been extended into the rear  verandah space to create two storage rooms. In most examples recorded the  central post had been retained (unusual in folk architecture elsewhere in  southern Africa) and, in a few isolated instances  the dwelling had two doorways, one to the front and one directly opposite, to  the rear.</p>
        <p>In most cases it was found that the  concept of a verandah had fallen by the wayside and that this dwelling form had  been supplanted by the simple cone on cylinder. However the verandah tradition  was found to have survived in many locations in the form of square plan  dwellings either surrounded by a small overhang or, more commonly in the Transvaal, with a wide verandah running the full length  of the dwelling facade (figure 19).</p>
        <p>Although the use of square plan dwellings  is not uncommon in contemporary Tswana architecture, their use is also by no  means widespread. Isolated rectangular structures, either gable-ended or more  often covered with a hipped roof, have been recorded in various locations both  in South Africa  and Botswana.  However the use of parapet or flat-roofed structures appears to be a feature of  more urbanised areas such as Winterveld, north of Pretoria, and parts of the northern Cape. Relatively few rural examples  have been recorded to date.</p>
        <p>The temporary hut has always had a place  in Tswana architecture, being used in the past for such varied functions as the  shelter of herd-boys, travelers and harvesters.&nbsp;  Latter-day temporary structures have been recorded more recently in the northern Cape, to the  north and west of Mafikeng. These were  essentially lean-to buildings consisting of two major timber posts placed some  4,000m apart and bridged by a timber beam laid horizontally at a height of  about 2,000m. Sheets of corrugated iron were then leant against this  rudimentary timber frame from either side and the structure was braced by two  triangular end-walls, one of which included the doorway opening. This resulted  in a triangular faced dwelling whose form was not unlike that of the hardbieshuis,  a structure originally used by Dutch settlers to the region up to the 1840s.</p>
        <h5>SOME GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF RURAL SETTLEMENT</h5>
        <p>The idea of &quot;rural settlement&quot;  as a series of huts placed haphazardly over the southern African countryside is  plainly mistaken. Not only is the indigenous homestead subject to a number of  principles which govern the distribution of its constituent parts but such  principles may be interpreted to represent a cognitive and unspoken language  which involves not only the social, political, economic, sexual, inheritance  and religious values of the people concerned but, in many ways also acts as a  mirror to their cosmological beliefs as a whole (Frescura, 1985: 349-363). As  such therefore, it may be concluded that the usage of space within the domestic  settlement represents a more reliable guideline to cultural pattern and group  identity than other elements, such as dwelling form and decorative motif, which  historical research has proved to be open to pragmatic manipulation (Frescura,  1987: 263-271).</p>
        <p>When applied to a wide range of examples,  research has also shown that the southern African region is currently the home  to two major architectural groupings: the Venda, a small minority inhabiting  the northern reaches of the Transvaal, and the  larger Nguni/Sotho/Tswana grouping, or virtually the remaining indigenous  population of southern Africa (Frescura, 1985:  364-367).</p>
        <p>The principles or, if we wish, the  vocabulary of such a language of settlement are based upon the following  factors:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>General  architectural form and governing axes.</li>
          <li>Aspect  and direction of approach and orientation.</li>
          <li>Hierarchical  determination and the relationships existing between husband and wife (or  wives), parents and children, family and visitors, domestic unit and community.</li>
          <li>Inheritance  patterns.</li>
          <li>The  architectural expression of territorial statements, common spaces, work areas  and privacy.</li>
          <li>Areas  of interaction between the individual family unit and the community as a whole.</li>
          <li>Position  of byre and other animal enclosures.</li>
          <li>Position  of cooking facilities and attendant work functions.</li>
          <li>Location  of burial areas and places of religious significance.</li>
          <li>Other  considerations such as seating hierarchies, and spatial divisions determined by  sex and age.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>HISTORY OF TSWANA SETTLEMENT</h5>
        <p>Our current understanding of the  principles which underlie the structuring of Tswana settlement was only gained  in relatively recent times. Early travelers to the region were initially unable  to perceive any but the most general of forms (figure 20) and significantly the  majority of their reports concentrated upon the individual dwelling unit. Some,  like Burchell, who described Dithakong in the northern Cape in 1812 as follows:</p>
        <p>&quot;<em>The buildings were nowhere ranged in  the form of streets, nor placed according to any regular plan; but were  scattered about, in some places far apart, and in others standing so closely  together as not to admit a passage for my waggons between them.</em>&quot; (1953: 254-256)</p>
        <p>could find little sense in their layouts  and although he later stated of the same town that it &quot;<em>... may be  considered as a collection of little villages, each under the superintendence  of its own chieftain ...</em>&quot; (1953: 360-372), he was unable to make the  link in his own understanding between the &quot;collection of little  villages&quot; and the extended family structure of the Tswana. On the  other hand, most early visitors to the Tswana were to express surprise and  astonishment at the size and scope of their towns. Dundas reported of Dithakong in 1801 that:</p>
        <p>&quot;<em>Passing through several large tracts  of ground, that were laid out and cultivated like so many gardens, we arrived  about noon at the city of Leetakoo, not a little astonished to find, in this  part of the world, a large and populous city.</em>&quot; (Barrow, 1801 and 1804: 114-116)</p>
        <p>The size of such towns varied quite  considerably. Lichtenstein estimated the population of Old Dithakong in 1805 at  about five thousand inhabitants, a figure confirmed by Burchell seven years  later (Lichtenstein, 1812 and 1815: 2: 379; Burchell, 1953: 360-372), whilst  Campbell, who visited the Hurutshe town of Kaditshwene in 1820, said:</p>
        <p>&quot;<em>It was impossible to number the  houses in Kurreechane, but probably the population may amount to sixteen  thousand, it being at least four times the size of New Lattakoo.</em>&quot; (1822: 1: 220-277)</p>
        <p>Despite their relative size, Tswana towns  were by no means permanent settlements. Dithakong, the capital of the Tlhaping,  is known to have been moved three times between 1802 and 1814, probably as the  result of internal schisms within the community and the need to find fresh  sources of grazing and building materials. However these dislocations are not  thought to have involved more than ten to twenty kilometres on each occasion  (Burchell, 1953: 360-372; Campbell, 1822: 1: 67).</p>
        <p>Travelers through this region were also  led to comment on the quality of urban life enjoyed by the Tswana. Burchell  visited &quot;Kramoni's&quot; homestead at Dithakong in 1812 and found  that &quot;It was one of the largest houses; nor could it be excelled by  any, in neatness and in the cleanliness and good order of every part.&quot;  (1953: 315-316), whilst Campbell  remarked a year later of the same town that:</p>
        <p>&quot;<em>One thing which makes an African  town appear to a European as dull and deserted is, the almost total absence of  smoke; but while we were walking, about sunset on the brow of a hill opposite  to the city, the fires were lighted up, it being a feast day, and the cloud of  smoke which in consequence hovered over the city, reminded me of London.</em>&quot; (1822: 1: 220-277)</p>
        <p>The same author also commented in 1820 that:</p>
        <p>&quot;<em>The stillness that prevails  universally over (Kaditshwene) in the night, particularly strikes a stranger;  indeed it is so great, that, when there happens to be no wind, if a person  coughs loud, all the dogs around bark.</em>&quot; (1822: 1: 229-277)</p>
        <p>However the first comprehensive analysis  of the Tswana built environment was only made by Schapera in the 1930s. In 1935  he defined the Tswana &quot;ward&quot; as a settlement containing  households belonging to segments of one or more agnatic lineages whose  constituent families are either closely related to the headman or otherwise  related through the male line to one common male ancestor (1935: 203-224).  Subsequently, in 1953, he stated that:</p>
        <p><em>&quot;The Tswana live in large compact  settlements ... In appearance the Tswana village is typically a cluster of  small circular hamlets separated from one another by narrow lanes or broad  roads. Each hamlet is inhabited by a single ward or sub-ward and their number  varies with the size and organisation of the population. Villages are normally  situated on the banks of rivers or at other places where water is readily  accessible, and preference seems to have been given to sites where hills afford  protection from enemy raiders.</em></p>
        <p><em>&quot;(The Tswana Homestead) is the smallest well-defined  social unit. It consists basically of a man with his wife or wives and their  unmarried children, but often includes one or more married sons, brothers or  even daughters, with their respective families. Polygamous households were  fairly common ...</em>&quot;  (1953: 35-36)</p>
        <p>It becomes obvious from the above that  although our understanding of the structuring of Tswana settlements has  increased considerably since the first white travelers entered Dithakong in  1801, the nature of these environments has changed little in the intervening  150 years (figure 21). Although present-day settlements are no longer as  compact as they were 100 or even 30 years ago, their builders are still being  guided by the same basic principles. This does not mean to imply that these, or  the society which gives rise to them, are static: merely that they are evidence  of a larger cultural framework within which changes are possible without  altering the essential nature of that society.</p>
        <h5>THE CONCEPT OF LEFT AND RIGHT</h5>
        <p>This is based upon the hierarchical  relationship perceived to exist between the &quot;first&quot; and  subsequent wives of a polygamous marriage. The interpretation of which hand is  assumed to be ascendant varies from group to group and is the subject of  numerous historical anecdotes or myths. Generally speaking it may be said that  those groups who hold &quot;right&quot; to be superior to &quot;left&quot;  explain this by means of a metaphor which reflects an old rural belief that a  warrior wields his spear with his right hand and his shield with his left. The  right is therefore assumed to have an ascendance over the left being &quot;active&quot;  and &quot;aggressive&quot; whilst the left is &quot;passive&quot;  and &quot;defensive&quot;. The Tswana are known to have built their  settlement in a roughly circular shape with a large space, being the men's area  and cattle byre, located at its centre. The domestic unit of the first wife of  the senior man or pater familias was sited at the head of the homestead  on the central axis of the settlement directly opposite the main entry to the  central space, with those of subsequent junior wives being located alternately  to her left and her right. The homesteads of his brothers or other members of  his retinue would then also be located alternately to the left and right of his  abode according to their descending order of status in relation to him. They,  in their turn, would also follow a left-right hierarchy in the distribution of  domestic units for their wives within their own individual residences. Today,  although it has been found that the circular fan pattern has fallen largely  into disuse and individual homesteads tend to follow a linear form along the  lines of land contour, the same considerations of left and right have prevailed  and are still being maintained by succeeding generations.</p>
        <h5>THE CONCEPT OF FRONT AND BACK</h5>
        <p>A second hierarchical differentiation  which may be said to exist in Tswana settlement arises between those domestic  units and homesteads closest to the central common, the residence of the  parents, and those located on the external perimeter, the residences of married  children. Although strictly speaking such a differentiation can best be  described as one existing between &quot;centre&quot; and &quot;perimeter&quot;,  this is only valid for as long as the settlement form remains circular. Once  the built environment breaks up into individual homesteads which tend to follow  a linear pattern along contour lines, a trend in Tswana settlement which has  accelerated in more recent times, then it will be seen that the traditional  centre-perimeter apposition will become translated into one based upon the  concept of front and back. In the context of the individual traditional Tswana  household, the opposition has always been one between &quot;front&quot;  and &quot;back&quot; where the dwelling of the parents is located in the  fore court or lobe of the homestead whilst the areas of privacy, of cooking and  of children's residence have been located to the rear.</p>
        <h5>THE BILOBIAL DOMESTIC UNIT</h5>
        <p>Historically, the planning of the Tswana  Iron Age domestic unit presents some interesting features. Its form, which  archaeologists currently describe as being &quot;bilobial&quot;, is  known to have been built in the southern African hinterland since the sixteenth  century and possibly earlier (Maggs, 1976). It consisted of two circular  courtyards, the front being a socialising space and the rear being given over  predominantly to work functions. Approach was made through a low semi-circle of  stones set on edge into the ground, probably to demarcate the line of a reed  screen such as may still be found in some Sotho or Ndebele homesteads. The  dwelling was located centrally at the intersection of the two circles and  access to the rear work space was made either through the back of the dwelling  itself or via a gap left in the courtyard wall to one side of the hut. In many recorded  instances the rear court was defined by means of a dry-stone wall of about  1,650m height. The masonry work was usually of a high standard and included the  detailing of such problem areas as the conjunction of walls and the provision  of outlets for surface water run-off. Wall-ends were neatly pointed and  returned (Taylor,  1979) (figure 22). The concept of a bilobial domestic unit may be seen to be  the product of the Tswana political system, whereby a polygamous society was  concentrated into densely populated villages, possibly through reasons of  infrastructure, defense or government. The breakdown of this form of domestic  unit, which has taken place in more recent times, can be attributed to an  increase in monogamous families and a decentralisation process in larger rural  settlements. This has given the Tswana domestic unit more room for lateral  expansion than was hitherto available to it. As a result the bilobial pattern  has undergone a number of evolutionary changes with the work area to the rear being  extended to enclose a number of service courtyards to the back and side of the  dwelling unit, thus losing its distinctive &quot;bilobial&quot; form  (Frescura, 1981: 154-157). (figure 23)</p>
        <h5>CONCLUSION</h5>
        <p>Although this paper has been formulated  from a predominantly historical and anthropological viewpoint, this was deemed  necessary to enable the lay reader to establish both the depth of Tswana  building traditions and the manner in which Tswana architecture acts as a  mirror to their social values and cultural mores. It is true that their built  environment is not as well documented as that of the Zulu or as photogenic as  that of the South Ndebele, but this does not detract from the fact that their  settlements and dwelling forms probably represent the longest surviving architectural  tradition in southern Africa. The complexity  of Tswana settlement, the textures of their dwelling forms and the variety of  their painted motifs &quot;excite the astonishment and seize the whole  attention of the visitor&quot; as much today as they did nearly two  centuries ago when they were visited by Burchell. It is unfortunate that a lack  of space has not made it possible to explore other important areas of Tswana  architecture such as their use of granaries, their adoption of White vernacular  forms like the kapsteilhuis, and a more comprehensive discussion on  their cognitive use of settlement space. The question of wall decoration is  also worthy of longer and more detailed analysis.</p>
        <h5>POSTSCRIPT</h5>
        <p>This paper owes its origins to a colleague who, in 1987, was  working in Bophuthatswana,  and decided to bring out a journal on local building developments. I am not  certain that a second edition of the journal was ever published (The Folk Architecture of the Tswana: A Historical and Current  Overview. Motlhatlhana, No 1, March 1987, Pretoria). It was extensively  revised and extended, and appeared in the SA Journal of Art and Cultural  History (Vol 3, No 2, 148-164: 1989) under the title of An Introduction to  Tswana Architecture.</p>
