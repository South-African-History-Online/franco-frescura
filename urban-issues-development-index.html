	  <p align="left">Franco Frescura</p>
	  <h5>PREAMBLE</h5>
	  <p>Some weeks ago the Editor of this journal requested me to examine,  in an essay, some of the problems and pitfalls facing the work of designers in  rural areas. I have found this difficult to do for a number of reasons. Most of  these center about a perception, which appears to have been gaining currency in  recent times, to the effect that urban blacks somehow comprise a separate  &quot;cultural&quot; group from their rural counterparts and should  therefore be given different treatment. Not only is this false, for it ignores  the social, cultural and economic links existing between the two communities,  but it should also be seen as part of the same governmental obsession which has  already divided South Africa's black population into ten &quot;ethnic&quot;  blocks. These divisions have largely been rejected by the people concerned, as  have been attempts to create an eleventh constituency out of a group whose  urban background has now placed them beyond &quot;ethnic&quot;  classification. Thus the problems being faced are not based upon a &quot;cultural&quot;  differentiation which some people perceive to exist between one black group and  another, or between urban and rural man, but between a European-based  socio-economic structure and that indigenous to southern Africa.  This means that although physical or social contexts may appear to place a  building in either an urban or a rural setting, the problems and value systems  involved should be seen to be common to both. For the purpose of this paper therefore  I propose to concentrate upon those problems I perceive to be facing designers  operating within the broad definition of a developing economy.</p>
	  <h5>SOME  PROBLEM AREAS</h5>
	  <p>Most of the problems encountered by designers working in the  context of a developing economy may be traced back to three primary areas of  concern:</p>
	  <h5>A.  PROBLEMS OF PERCEPTION</h5>
	  <p>These relate to the difficulties experienced by professional  designers in formulating their briefs and in understanding the nature of their  clients needs and realities. This is a failure liable to occur at any stage of  the design process and is probably the most common problem experienced by  architects in developing areas. It may be attributed to the fact that, when  faced with a design problem, many professionals tend to interpret the social,  technological, economic and cultural factors placed before them in terms of  their own experience and value structures and not those of their clients.  Although more often than not this may be attributable to the insensitivity, or the  ignorance, of the designer concerned, some have gone so far as to claim that to  do otherwise is tantamount to a form of racism and thus deliberately set out to  ignore such evidence.</p>
	  <p>Examples of this abound throughout the developing world. One need  only look at the new town of Chandigarh in India where,  given an architectural tradition reaching back two thousand years, the Swiss le  Corbusier imposed a rigid grid-iron plan upon the landscape and populated it  with uncompromising concrete structures built in a brutalist International  style. Not only that but he also serviced the town with six lane highways -  this is a community which relies on oxcarts and bicycles as its predominant  forms of transport.</p>
	  <p>Another piece of architectural foolishness may be found at Brasilia, where  Niemeyer's designs for Brasil's new administrative capital effectively  bankrupted that nation and forced it to make foreign loans which are still  being repaid forty years later. A similar gaffe was perpetuated by the military  rulers of Nigeria  who, during the early 1970's, found themselves endowed with a cornucopia of  new-found wealth from their oil resources and thus decided to embark on an  ambitious programme of public works. As a result they ordered the import of  some 90 million tons of cement. It was only when foreign cargo ships laden with  cement began queuing up off Lagos harbour that it was discovered that the  country had off-loading facilities to handle only 7 million tons per annum.</p>
	  <h5>B.  PROBLEMS OF IMPLEMENTATION</h5>
	  <p>These relate largely to areas of technology where a design is  based upon preconceived assumptions unsupported by empirical on-site  observations, or the implementation of design solutions which fail when local  conditions and technology prove unequal to the demands placed upon them. In  this respect South Africa can boast of a few home-grown blunders of its own:  like the time when the people of Johannesburg looked on with understandable  anxiety as one of the new Standard Bank's massive prefabricated beams hung  suspended precariously twenty storeys from the ground because of an engineering  miscalculation about the differential movement of concrete structures; or, more  recently, the overloading of the new Stock Exchange's air-conditioning system  after one of the mining companies had erected its prestige reflective  glass-plated headquarters on the southern side of their building.</p>
	  <h5>C.  PROBLEMS OF EXPECTATION</h5>
	  <p>These relate not so much to the technical performance of a  structure as to the expectations which the client will have of his building  once it is erected. The most common failure in this regard may be found in the  field of domestic architecture where a designer's unexplained drawings can  arouse expectations of scale, form and finishes which the final product does  not meet. Monty Python's satirical sketch of an architect providing his client  with a well-appointed abattoir when the brief required a block of flats is not  as surrealistic as it sounds, especially when the architect excuses himself by  stating that he had &quot;not divined the client's attitude&quot; towards his  tenants!</p>
	  <p>It will be evident that design failures are not necessarily the  result of any one of these factors acting individually but, rather, are often  the outcome of any number of them acting in combination with each other.&nbsp; Perhaps these points are best illustrated  through a number of case studies.</p>
	  <h5>BISHO,  THE WORLD'S FIRST (AND ONLY) POST   MODERNIST CITY</h5>
	  <p>The boundaries of what was to become known as the &quot;Ciskei&quot;  were established as early as 1913 when parts of this region were set aside by  the Union Government for exclusive black settlement. During the 1960s and 1970s  the area was used by South Africa  as a dumping ground for the forcible resettlement of many black residents of  the Cape. As a result some villages became little  better than rural slums where unemployment and starvation were endemic. The  Visagie survey of 1978 found that kwashiokor affected 27% of all infants  in the 6 to 23 month age group. As late as 1985 the Herman/Windham study  established that between 1970 and 1983 approximately one infant in every five  born in the region died before it reached the age of five. In 1980 the Quail  Commission stated that 95% of Ciskeian workers in employment held jobs in white  South Africa.</p>
	  <p>When the Ciskei  opted for independence in 1981 under the South African Government's Bantustan policy, it did so with the consent of  only a small minority of its population and against the specific  recommendations of its appointed consultants. In the process it inherited a  legacy of poverty unequalled in modern-day southern Africa.</p>
	  <p>The development of Bisho, the Ciskei's new capital, must then be  viewed in the context of these factors. The town lies some six kilometers north  of King William's Town on the main road linking the Cape to the Transkei and Natal. Its location was dictated by a wish on  the part of the Ciskei  to place an economic stranglehold upon the white community of King William's  Town who, Prog, Nat and HNP, stand united against incorporation into the  homeland. When questioned on the subject residents point, with some reason, to  the Ciskei's long history of political and economic mismanagement: the location  of a new hospital below the flood plain of the Keiskamma River by Israeli  &quot;experts&quot;; the building of a multi-million Rand &quot;international&quot;  airport (soon to be followed by an equally expensive &quot;international&quot;  hotel) outside Bisho; the purchase of a R36 million jet aircraft which cannot  obtain a permit to fly; and a string of internecine rifts, vigilante violence,  attempted coups d'etat and military invasions which have typified the  government of President Sebe.</p>
	  <p>The visitor approaching Bisho is immediately struck by the  surrealistic image of a town rising abruptly out of the landscape. The odd  juxtaposition of a stranded CBD, ready-made and unsupported by a residential  component, against a backdrop of wide-open veld, is bizarre to say the least.  As evening approaches, day-trippers disappear into the veld leaving the streets  empty for the goats that amble along, &quot;wending their weary way&quot;  from nowhere to nowhere.</p>
	  <p>The Master Plan for the town has clearly been disregarded by the  architects, as buildings jostle with each other, each clamouring for attention.  Neighbours are rudely ignored and spaces between buildings carelessly abandoned  to dust and litter.</p>
	  <p>Most of the buildings are treated in the Post-Modern idiom, a  style of architecture intended to facilitate meaningful communication.  Ironically, virtually no references are drawn from the region or the culture of  the Ciskeian people. Unimpeded by the constraints of an established urban  setting and a sophisticated and critical audience, the architects are having a  field day. Bisho is a town that is as unlovely as it is apparently unloved.  Perhaps Italo Calvino was right when he said that &quot;<em>a town without old  buildings is like a man without a memory</em>&quot;; but the problem with Bisho  lies not only in its lack of old buildings but in the quality of the new.</p>
	  <p>The designers of Bisho will have much to answer to in future  times. Why, for example, did they lend their skills to build what is so  obviously a fantasy town relevant only to the dreams and aspirations of a small  minority of Ciskeians? Why was it permitted to develop on its present site when  neighbouring King William's Town remains so obviously the region's major  economic centre? Why does its architecture mirror the effete fashion of an  American culture half a world away and ignore so obviously local forms and  traditions? Why, above all, will designers not learn to say &quot;No&quot;  to a brief which is so obviously flawed?</p>
	  <h5>THE  SOWETO OLD AGE HOME</h5>
	  <p>This project was initiated in about 1982 by a group of South  African Rotarians who, for reasons of their own, wished to build what would  have been Soweto's (and possibly this country's) first old age home for blacks.  Although the design was handled by a firm of prominent Johannesburg architects, I was asked by the  community concerned to join the committee in an advisory capacity. This was  owed more to the fact that the community was having difficulty in communicating  with the architects than with the latter's design abilities, which were never  brought into doubt.</p>
	  <p>It soon became apparent that a number of important questions were  being asked which neither the architects not the clients were able to answer  comprehensively. These hinged about the concept of an &quot;old age home&quot;  which, the community felt, originated in white society and had no place amongst  blacks, who pride themselves on the fact that they include the elderly into  their extended family structures. Whites, on the other hand, were perceived by  them, rightly or wrongly, to have a throw-away attitude towards their parents,  their spouses and their children whilst bestowing undue care and attention to  old buildings, books and artifacts. Other considerations also arose, such as  the height of beds, attitudes to death, religious functions, connections with  the community and the ability of the buildings to convert to other functions  should the project not succeed.</p>
	  <p>Ultimately, however, the project was torpedoed by simple financial  considerations: the clients were prepared to spend R1.5 million upon the  buildings but had not taken into account the fact that such an institution  would require an approximate R20,000 per week to keep it operational. The  community certainly had no such means at hand and when the Government indicated  that it would not be subsidising this venture, the project was abandoned.</p>
	  <h5>INKONZO  YOVUKO, CHURCH OF THE RESURRECTION, PORT    ELIZABETH</h5>
	  <p>This project was initiated recently by the (black) Anglican  community of Walmer Township, Port    Elizabeth in conjunction with the Department of  Architecture at UPE. It illustrates an attempt to bring together the cultural  traditions of Xhosa architecture with the liturgical needs of a Christian  community to produce a building which is both unique to this region and  conforms to the limited financial resources of the clients.</p>
	  <p>The building itself has an ufokona or square plan but a  series of four apses gives it an overall cruciform shape. This is important for  the site lies near the airport and will be seen from the air by passengers  arriving into or departing from Port    Elizabeth. The symmetrical plan focuses upon a central  altar, placed upon the site of the traditional iziko or hearth, the  source of light, warmth and nourishment in a traditional dwelling. This  generates a circular seating plan, a pre-requisite of the client's brief, which  harkens back to customary Xhosa gathering forms. A second altar, the entla,  has been placed in a chapel apse to the rear of the church. This is a location  associated in Black tradition with the ancestors and is therefore of great  spiritual significance. It also allows for the performance of the Mass along  more conventional lines thereby fulfilling the architectural brief of the more  conservative section of the congregation.</p>
	  <p>Entry to the building is gained via a traditional isitupu  or entrance step which leads into an entrance lobby opposite the entla  altar. This creates a central axis within the church dividing its interior into  the traditional icala Lamadoda, the side of the men where the vestries  are located, and the icala Labufazi, the side of the women where the  kitchen is also found. This division is, of course, only metaphorical, but it  does give rise to a further reference to traditional Xhosa life. The side of  the men is also known as the &quot;side of life&quot; and hence was considered  to be the natural site for the baptismal font.</p>
	  <p>The roof structure is further reminiscent of traditional Xhosa  building methods. The structure over the main body of the church is supported  by four main trusses called the isibonda held together at the apex by  cross-members called the indibano. This is further reinforced by an umqolo  or ring beam whilst the intsika or centre post, used as an additional  support to the roof during thatching and then cut off below the cross-piece, is  allowed to emerge through the isiciko or apex capping piece to become a  four directional cross. A further cross, made from timber extracted from  demolished squatter shacks in Walmer, hangs below the cut-off intsika.  The lower two thirds of the roof are sheathed in corrugated iron whilst the top  third is covered with translucent sheeting. This not only sets out to evoke the  imagery and soft lighting of a partly thatched roof but it also makes symbolic  reference to the abakwetha hut, a building of religious and spiritual  significance which the Xhosa traditionally leave partly unfinished.</p>
	  <p>The brief was formulated and the design was executed following  extensive consultations with the community concerned. This involved not only  prolonged meetings with the larger congregation but their representatives also  took extensive part in the design process, often sketching their ideas out  themselves or manipulating the basic elements of a 1:50 scale model. As a  result it was found that the general community was highly literate in both the  reading of two-dimensional plans and the use of symbolic space and  architectural metaphors. The role of the designer in such a process was in no  way limited. Indeed their participation enriched both the design and his  experience and his work was given added meaning and dimension by being brought  into the ambit of the larger community. Similar personal experiences have also  been shared in the conversion of a Johannesburg  warehouse into Open School premises, the provision of housing for some  230 families in Soweto and, more recently, the  design of a self-help project aimed at providing a community of some 400  Ndebele with reticulated water and sewage services in Bophuthatswana.</p>
	  <h5>SOME  CONCLUSIONS</h5>
	  <p>When, in 1923, Corbusier wrote words to the effect that society  had a choice between revolution and architecture, his cry became the rallying  call of a whole generation of Modern Movement architects. They acted in the  belief the nature of the built environment had the power, good or bad, of  bringing about radical changes in the society it housed. Despite the fact that  this hypothesis has since been shown by sociologists, psychologists and  planners to have been based upon a number of false premises, architects of  today persist in the fond belief that their sole responsibility to the  betterment of society is to provide it with beautiful buildings.</p>
	  <p>The relevance of such an attitude in the context of a developing  or under-developed economy such as ours must be severely questioned. For one  thing local architects are traditionally perceived, by white and black alike,  to be closely allied to political systems which favour the powerful and the  rich. For another architects tend to service the needs of those best able to  afford the luxury of a specialised designer. Black society has neither a  tradition of specialised builders nor does it have a name for them. The work of  the architect therefore is seen as being largely irrelevant to the needs of a  future South African society.</p>
	  <p>This means that a progressive-thinking architect, seeking to make  a socially valid contribution under the present political system will find his  role and the scope of his operation seriously curtailed by a variety of  factors. Many an architectural firm's ardour for social reform has been cooled  by the meagre returns made by such a market or by the bureaucracy and  corruption involved. Ultimately he will be forced into a position of having to  make what some observers in other fields have described as the &quot;liberal  compromise&quot;. In architecture this means that he will have to define for  himself a role that neither links him to government nor big business but still  allows him to earn a living for himself and his dependants. This means that in  such fields as black housing, where his work can at best be described as the  sugar coating upon an extremely bitter pill, the architect will be able to  derive a measure of social credibility and approval from the community  concerned whilst knowing perfectly well that his work does not begin to address  the problem of housing at its root causes. This calls for a dedicated  missionary attitude towards architecture or, at the very least, a degree of  ideological motivation which, I fear, few architects have displayed publicly to  date.</p>
	  <p>The case studies discussed above provide a number of important  lessons. Through them it becomes possible to formulate guidelines which, I  believe, should characterize the work of a progressively minded architectural  practice of the future. These include the following important features:</p>
	  <ol>
	    <li>An  orientation towards developmental, labour-intensive work as against commercial,  capital intensive and largely urban projects.</li>
	    <li>Clients  will be included as active participants in the design process, and not as the  mere consumers of an end product.</li>
	    <li>Clients  will tend to be whole communities or their representative bodies rather than  individuals. The work will therefore entail a high degree of consultation with  the client body as a whole.</li>
	    <li>Projects  will be aimed at local job creation and economic development within the  communities concerned rather than at the generation of wealth for large scale  capitalist enterprise.</li>
	    <li>In  some instances the architect may be part of and not necessarily the leader of a  multi-disciplinary team of experts.</li>
	    <li>The  design should be part of a larger planning process which questions the basic  premises of the brief. If the brief fails to meet some of the criteria outlined  above, then the commission may be turned down or the brief amended.</li>
	    <li>The  practice would be involved in the educational process of young architects-to-be  either through direct participation in formal university teaching or through an  informal in-house training programme aimed at developing the architectural  skills of young draftsmen prior to their entrance into university.</li>
	    <li>The  practice would incorporate in its project development an active programme of  research and data publication. It is probable that architects belonging to such  a practice would also be actively encouraged to pursue post-graduate studies.</li>
	    </ol>
	  <p>To summarise, it is probable that progressively minded designers,  conscious of their social responsibilities, will opt to exercise their skills  in projects whose scope and size will allow them to remain in full control of  the production process and in close contact with their client rather than  ventilate their collective ego through the kind of antisocial megalomania which  punctuates our urban skylines. It goes almost without saying that police stations,  sectarian monuments, corporate headquarters, Bantustan Legislative Assembly  halls and District Six condominium developments will not feature in their  curriculum vitae.</p>
	  <h5>POSTSCRIPT</h5>
	  <p>This paper was originally presented at the African Studies 33rd Annual Meeting on Africa: Development and Ethics, Baltimore, 1-4 November  1990. It was subsequently published under the title of Designing for a  Developing Economy, in Building, 19 April 1989: 11-15.</p>
