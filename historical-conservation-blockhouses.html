	    BLOCKHOUSE FORTIFICATIONS OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN WAR</h5>
	  <p>Franco Frescura	    </p>
	  <p>During the South African War of 1899-1902  blockhouses formed an essential part of British military strategy against the  Boers. Initially these were fairly substantial and were used to guard key  military points, but once the war moved into its final stages, they were used,  together with barbed wire, as a means of limiting the movement of Boer  commandos. All in all, some 8000 blockhouses were built over a period of two  years, and although most were eventually dismantled, a number still remain in  silent testimony of a bitter and foolish war. </p>
	  <p>When war broke out in October 1899 the  British army was faced with the problem of engaging an enemy in the southern  African interior with lines of communication stretching some 800-1200 km. The  nearest available ports were Cape Town, Port Elizabeth and East London, and the  only rapid means of reaching the theatre of battle available to them was the  Cape&rsquo;s newly-developed railway system whose lines had only reached Colesberg in  1883, Kimberley in 1885, and Mafeking in 1894. The shorter route from Durban had been cut off early on in the war by the Boer  invasion of Natal,  and in order to limit the threat of Boer attacks upon the railway  infrastructure further south, the British began to build a series of  blockhouses to guard key railway points and bridges.</p>
	  <p>At first the men on sentry duty lived in  either army tents or in corrugated iron sheds provided by the railways. However  these structures offered little protection from either the excesses of the  South African climate or from Boer bullets, and a more substantial type of  structure was clearly called for. Work on a number of fortified blockhouses  began towards the end of 1900, at a time when the war was reaching a stalemate  and Boer military strategy was shifting from the battlefield to the  redeployment of troops into highly mobile detachments of horse commandos. The  ranks of the British army included a number of well-qualified builders, stone  masons and architects, whose services were transferred to the Royal Engineers.  Consequently the quality of the work on these early structures was of a  generally high standard.</p>
	  <p>The first blockhouses were substantial  square-plan structures, three-storeys high, built in dressed stone and finished  with a low-pitch corrugated iron roof. Steel-protected embrasures were located  on each floor, while two steel boxes projected at diagonally opposite corners  of the top floor to provide covering cross-fire to the walls below. Access to  the first floor was by means of a two-piece, bullet-proof steel door located  high above the ground floor. This could only be reached by means of a  retractable ladder which was hoisted upwards by means of steel tackle. Floors  consisted of timber planks carried by a framework of steel joists built into  the stonework. The sleeping quarters were located on the first floor, while  most of the ground floor was taken up by a large water tank. The design was  developed by the army&rsquo;s chief engineer in South   Africa, General Sir Elliot Wood, who based it upon a  similar pattern he had used in the Sudan during the 1880&rsquo;s. Examples  of this structure may still be found at Wellington,  Burgersdorp, Harrismith, Wolseley, Montagu, Prieska and Laingsburg, while  others are scattered about the Magaliesberge and the foothills of the  Drakensberge. A miniaturised version may also be found in the cemetery at  Darling.</p>
	  <p>Although Wood&rsquo;s design was excellent and did  good service in guarding the railway links, it was too substantial and hence  too expensive and time-consuming to build. These shortcomings became more  evident after January 1901 when the Boers began to redefine the nature of the  conflict and reconstituted their field forces into smaller groups of highly  mobile horse commandos. The wide-open plains of the southern African interior  presented few obstacles to their movement and when the Boers invaded the Cape  for the second time, they were able to drive deep into British territory and  hit with impunity at civilian targets, causing havoc to the Colony&rsquo;s  well-established civilian service infrastructure. In an attempt to limit these  guerrilla tactics the British began to criss-cross the country with a series of  barbed wire fences, which they hoped would hamper commando movement and  eventually force their surrender. By the end of the war, in May 1902, the main  lines of barbed wire stretched from Cape Town to Mafeking, Port Elizabeth to De  Aar, Naaupoort to Pietersburg, East London to Aliwal North, Rustenburg to  Lourenco Marques, Durban to Mafeking, and from Hutchinson to Carnarvon,  Calvinia, and thence through to the west coast. In most cases these ran  alongside existing railway lines, which made the task of patrolling them, and  of servicing the needs of men on sentry duty, a relatively simple matter. The wire  used varied from the simple, two-strand coil to the much-vaunted eight-stranded  variety, which was reputed to be &lsquo;uncuttable&rsquo;.</p>
	  <p>Blockhouses formed an essential part of this  policy, and it was planned to string out a series of these structures along the  fences within sight of each other. The number involved was massive, and because  the Wood prototype was too substantial for this use, a smaller, more affordable  unit, suitable for mass-production, was called for. The answer was provided by  Major SR Rice, of the Royal Engineers, who reduced the concept of a blockhouse  to a simple cylindrical drum topped by a corrugated iron roof and surrounded at  its base by a circular wall of stones or sand-bags. The inner tower was created  by placing two corrugated-iron water tanks of differing diameters, one within  the other, and filling the space between them with stones and earth. The  perimeter defences were often supplemented by trenches, but these were used  more as shelters than firing positions. The final product may not have been as  permanent as Wood&rsquo;s design, but then it was not as expensive.</p>
	  <p>Boredom and troop morale were probably the  greatest problems faced by the military. Gardening and gambling were favourite  pastimes, but some ingenious troopers also spent time devising alarms involving  old tins, pebbles and trap guns set to go off should anything brush against the  wire. At the height of this programme some 56 000 soldiers were tied up on  blockhouse sentry duty, with thousands more being involved in the transportation  and distribution of supplies and stores. </p>
	  <p>In addition to these blockhouses, a number  of other structures, similarly inexpensive, were used to strengthen the  defences of smaller towns and villages. George, for instance, had six in the  town and two overlooking the Montagu   Pass. Despite, or perhaps  because, of these precautions, George was never attacked, and the only shooting  incident involving the military during this time resulted in the death of a  donkey. Other villages were not as fortunate, and the commandos ranged widely  from Darling in the western Cape, to Okiep in  Namaqualand, and Lady Grey in the eastern    Cape. In particular they targeted the postal and  transport infrastructure, as well as those Dutch families whom they considered  to have betrayed their cause, often flogging their men and burning their  property.</p>
	  <p>Although some members of the Boer  leadership, such as General Christiaan de Wet, were openly dismissive of the  blockhouse policy, describing it as the &lsquo;Blockhead system&rsquo;, others, like General  Louis Botha, were more realistic in their assessment when they stated that  blockhouses &lsquo;are likely to prove the ruin of our commandos&rsquo;. Thus even though  relatively few blockhouses saw action, they nonetheless played an important  role in bringing the conflict to an end. After the war they were abandoned, and  although a number of units built to Wood&rsquo;s design have survived to the present  day, Rice&rsquo;s blockhouses were dismantled almost immediately by the civilian  rural population, who were now displaced, homeless, and in dire need of  building materials. </p>
