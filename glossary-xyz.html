		<p><strong>X</strong></p>
		<p>XESIBE. Nguni-speaking group originating from  the northern Transkei. The people are more correctly known as the amaXesibe.<br />
		  XHOSA. Nguni-speaking group originating from  the southern Transkei, Ciskei and eastern Cape region. The people are more  correctly known as the amaXhosa and their language is referred to as isiXhosa.<br />
		  XHOSA ARCHITECTURE. Although the Xhosa-speaking groups of  southern Africa cannot by any means be considered as a single entity, their  architectural culture has achieved a large degree of homogeneity. At one time  most, if not all, are thought to have built hemispherical grass beehive  dwellings but, since the early 1900s, these have been replaced with circular  plan cone on cylinder structures. Barring a few regional variations in building  methods and material textures, these present a uniform architectural style for  the region. This has increased since the mid-1920s when local women began to  whitewash monochromatic patterns upon their residence facades, leading to some  chroniclers making reference to them as being &quot;white faced&quot;.</p>
		<h5>Y</h5>
		<p>		  YARN. See under THATCHING TWINE. (Afrikaans: tou).<br />
		  YASTI. (Indian). A mast rising from the crown  of a stupa&rsquo;s dome (anda), signifying the world-axis, extending from earth to  heaven. The mast is a support for chattras, or symbolic parasols, which are  usually found in groups of three in early Buddhist stupas, signifying Buddha,  Dharma (the law), and Sangha (the community of monks).<br />
		  YEALM. Prepared layer of wetted straw 350-450mm  wide and 100-150mm thick. (Afrikaans: nat dekgraslaag).<br />
		  Yezitena. (isiXhosa). Derived from the Afrikaans baksteen,  meaning a brick. Baked or sun-dried brick.<br />
		  YONI. (Indian). The female generative organ;  the vulva. The symbol of the female principle. May serve as the pedestal or  receiver of the linga enshrined in a Saivite temple. Together, the linga  and yoni represent the unity within duality that is central to much  Hindu thought.</p>
		<h5>Z</h5>
		<p>		  ZINC ROOF SHEETING. A whitish-blue metal used in flexible  metal roofing and as a protective coating to corrugated steel sheeting.  (Afrikaans: sinkdunplaat).<br />
		  ZOLDER. From the Dutch. Attic room found in many  rural Cape Dutch dwellings, functional as either a storage or sleeping space.  Normally accessed through a door in the side gable of the building.<br />
		  ZULU. Originally a small Nguni-speaking group  numbering about 2000 persons inhabiting the region of northern Zululand between  the upper Mhlatuzi and the White Mfolozi Rivers. They rose to political  dominance under the leadership of Shaka between 1816 and 1819. Ultimately the  Zulu kingdom spread along the eastern littoral from the Pongola in the north to  the Tukela in the south. The word amaZulu literally means &quot;children  of the sky&quot; and refers to the people as a whole, their country is KwaZulu  and their language is referred to as isiZulu.<br />
		  ZULU ARCHITECTURE. The architecture of KwaZulu was marked,  up to recent times, for its wide use of grass-thatched beehive dwellings sited  in wide circular settlements about a central cattle byre. This popular  stereotype however has undergone extensive revision since the 1950s when the  ubiquitous cone on cylinder began to replace the more picturesque but less  efficient domical structures.</p>
