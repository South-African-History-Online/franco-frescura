		<p><strong>LIGHTHOUSES  OF THE CAPE COLONY</strong></p>
		<p>As an  introduction to the description of the lighthouses of Cape Colony which forms  the subject of this paper, it is desirable to refer briefly to the system of  administration
	    now  obtaining.</p>
		<p> The Coast  lighthouses are under the sole control of the Public Works Department.&nbsp; This Department is directly responsible for  the employment and training of the light keeping staff, the maintenance of the  existing lights and fog signals, the provision of new lights and the
	    construction of  all towers and other buildings therefore.</p>
		<p> In addition,  this Department maintains all beacons, buoys and signal stations in the Colony  with the exception of some few small harbour lights maintained by the local  harbour
		  authorities  at Cape Town, Simonstown, Port Elizabeth and East London.</p>
		<p> Contrary to  the practice which obtains in the United Kingdom and some other countries, no  light dues are levied on shipping by, or in the Colony, the entire cost of  coast lighting being provided out of the Colonial Revenue.&nbsp;Thus the funds for the maintenance and  improvement of existing lights and the provision of new lights are dependent on  the will of
		  Parliament.&nbsp; The Author does not propose to discuss either  the merits or demerits of this system.</p>
		<p> The progress  in the methods of coast lighting has been extensive of late years.&nbsp; Smeaton's early effort at the famous  Eddystone was but a step in advance of the beacon fires, and was a mere  chandelier holding 24 tallow candles of two-fifths of a pound each, and having  a power of 2.8 standard candles.&nbsp; The  entire power of the 24 candles amounted to 67.2 candles, and at present rates  would be at a cost of nearly 4s. per hour.&nbsp;  When one compares this with a
		  modern light  of half a million candles power at a cost of 21/2d. per hour, the difference is  striking.</p>
		<p> Lighting  apparatus may be divided into three classes:&nbsp;  first Catoptric, in which the light is merely reflected.&nbsp; Second, Cata-dioptric, in which reflectors  are used in conjunction<br />
		  with lenses  through which the light passes.&nbsp; Third,  Dioptric lenses through which the entire light passes, being gathered from the  burning intensified, and directed according to the
		  type of lens  used.</p>
		<p> The latter is  the most modern and efficient method of lighting.</p>
		<p> The  illuminants have also undergone extensive changes, and may be classed in orde4r  of merit as follows:</p>
		<p> Candles,  wickburners consuming fish or colza oils, wickburners consuming petroleum,  electric light, incandescent petroleum - vapour burners.</p>
		<p> The system of  ignited petroleum vapour for the incandescence in the Welsbach mantle has been  in use in France since 1898, in England since 1902, and in this Colony since  1903.&nbsp; The
		  advantage of  this incandescent burner above all others may be understood from the fact that  by its introduction in this Colony most of our lights have been increased in  power by
		  over 400  percent and with a reduction in oil consumption of 40 percent.</p>
		<p> The vapour  burners used in this Colony are of three sizes, ie</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p> That having a  mantle of 55 m/m diameter.<br />
		    That having a  mantle of 85 m/m diameter.<br />
		    That having  three mantles of 55 m/m diameter.</p>
	    </blockquote>
		<p> A glance at  the map will show that the first light on the coast of the Colony going West to  East is Dassen Island.<br />
		  This  lighthouse was erected in 1893 on the highest portion of Dassen Island, a low rocky  islet in latitude 33 degrees 26 S, longitude 18 degrees 5' 3'' E.&nbsp; The focal plane is at a level
		  of 150 feet  above high water, thus giving the light a range of 18 miles.</p>
		<p> NOTE.- In  calculating the geographical range of a light, it is usual to take the range  due to elevation of the focal plane above the level of high water, and to add  to this the additional range obtained by virtue of the eye of the observer above  sea level, which is assumed to be 15 feet.&nbsp;  The addition to the actual range of the light is therefore 4.44 nautical  miles or roughly 4 1/2 nautical miles.&nbsp;  This addition is made in stating the range of lights in all official  lists of lights and is included in the ranges given in this paper.</p>
		<p> In the case  of some lights of small power the effective range is less than the theoretical geographical  range owing to loss of power in the beam to penetrate the atmosphere so far as
		  the horizon.</p>
		<p> The tower  which is circular in plan and 95 feet in height from the ground level to  lantern balcony is constructed of cast iron segments, the flanges of which are  bolted together internally.&nbsp; The tower is  founded upon and secured to a massive base of granite masonry 15 feet in height  which also serves to provide accommodation for stores.&nbsp; The lantern is
		  12 feet  internal diameter with circular glazing and vertical and horizontal  framing.&nbsp; It is surmounted by a double  sheeted copper dome with a Trinity House pattern ventilator.</p>
		<p> The optical  apparatus is of the first order, diptric of 920 m/m focal radius emitting a  double flashing white light of the following period:-</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p> Flash&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 seconds.<br />
		    Eclipse&nbsp; 4 seconds.<br />
		    Flash&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 seconds.<br />
		    Eclipse 20  seconds.<br />
		    ___________________<br />
		    Total&nbsp;&nbsp; 30 seconds.</p>
	    </blockquote>
		<p> The optic is  four-sided, each side being sub-divided so as to produce two flashes.&nbsp; One revolution of the apparatus therefore  produces 8 flashes or 4 complete periods, and is
		  made in 120  seconds.&nbsp; The moving portion of the optic  weighing about 3 tons is supported on a set of 8 vertical steel rollers and  guided horizontally by 16 brass rollers.&nbsp;  The necessary motive power is derived from a weight driven clock regulated  by a &quot;<em>Slight</em>&quot; governor.&nbsp; The  actual driving weight is 6 cwts. and the clock regulated wound.&nbsp; A speed indicator is fitted as well as hand  turning gear for use in case of derangement of the driving machine.</p>
		<p> The  illuminant in use when the light was first erected was a 6 wick Trinity House  Douglass burner, giving a power to the beam of 47,000 candles, and having a  yearly consumption of
		  1,800 gallons  of mineral oil of specially heavy grade.</p>
		<p> During 1906  these burners were replaced by incandescent oil vapour burners having a mantle  of 85 m/m diameter.&nbsp; The use of this  burner has increased the power of the beam to 180,000 candles, at the same time  bringing about a smaller consumption of oil and a resultant saving in cost of  maintenance of 80 per annum.</p>
		<p> Communication  is maintained with the Island by steamer once a month and by pigeon post.&nbsp; Proposals have been framed to provide  communication by means of aetheric signalling, but
		  these have not  yet been carried into effect.</p>
		<p> Proceeding,  the next light on the list is Robben Island in Table Bay.&nbsp; This light, which was built in 1865, is  situated in latitude 33 degrees 48.9' S, longitude 18 degrees 22.5' E,
		  and has a  range of 18 miles; the focal plane being 154 feet above high water.&nbsp; The tower, circular in plan, is built of masonry  and is 60 feet high from ground level to balcony.</p>
		<p> The lantern  is circular with a cast iron base or murette.</p>
		<p> The glazing  is flat, set in inclined frames.&nbsp; The  dome is of copper, double lined, and ventilated by means of a revolving
		  perforated  ball cowl.&nbsp; Until 1907, the illuminating  apparatus
		  consisted of  a first order dioptric fixed lens belt with upper
		  and lower  refracting zones and exhibiting a fixed white light
		  of a little  over 5,000 candle power.</p>
		<p> By the simple  expedient of providing a set of revolving
		  screens  carried on an aluminium float in a mercury bath the
		  apparatus was  in 1907 converted into an occulting light with 
		  a  characteristic of, light 5 seconds, eclipse 2 seconds.</p>
		<p> While this  alteration in the characteristic of, light was in
		  progress,  advantage was taken of the opportunity to increase
		  the power of  the beam and an 85 m/m vapour burner
		  installation  was provided which increased the power of the
		  light to  23,000 candles.</p>
		<p> The wreck of  the TANTALLON CASTLE on Robben Island in 1901
		  impressed  upon the Government the urgent necessity for the
		  provision of  a fog signal at this point, and in 1902 an
		  explosive  signal was erected in connection with the
		  lighthouse.&nbsp; It may be of interest to mention that the
		  average fog  duration at Robben Island is practically the same
		  as the  average for the English Channel, viz, 430 hours.&nbsp; The
		  fog signal  apparatus consists of a steel mast surrounded at
		  its base by a  sheet steel cabin containing the necessary
		  stores and  electric battery.&nbsp; The charge, which is fired  once
		  in 5 minutes,  consists of 4 ounces of &quot;<em>Tonite</em>&quot; or nitrated
		  gun cotton,  into which is inserted a fulminate of mercury
		  detonator.&nbsp; The cartridge is attached to the end of two
		  conductors  which are secured to an electrical contact plate.</p>
		<p> This contact  maker is hoisted by means of a flexible steel
		  cable passing  over a pulley at the mast head and attached to
		  a small hand  winch near the base of the mast.&nbsp; The  contact
		  plate at the  end of the travel of the cable completes the
		  electric  circuit by touching similar plates at the jib head
		  and the  charge is thus automatically fired.&nbsp; The  practical
		  range of this  signal under average atmospheric conditions is
		  about 7  miles, although under favourable circumstances it may
		  be heard over  20 miles.&nbsp; An underground magazine is  provided
		  for the  storage of the main supply of explosives and<br />
		  detonators.
		  Communication  is made with the mainland by a submarine
		  telephonic  cable.</p>
		<p> MOUILLE POINT  LIGHT
		  in Table Bay  was established in 1842, and disestablished on
		  15th April  1908.&nbsp; It was merely a small leading  light to the
		  anchorage.&nbsp; Its place has now been taken by the provision  of
		  a small fourth  order occulting red light at a seaward end of
		  the harbour  breakwater and has rendered the continuance of
		  the Mouille  Point Light unnecessary.&nbsp; The new light  is lit by
		  electric  current.</p>
		<p><strong> GREEN POINT  LIGHT, TABLE BAY</strong></p>
		<p> The early  history of this light is unauthentic, and the
		  Author has  been unable to determine its origin from
		  authoritative  documents.&nbsp; It is said, however, that the  tower
		  was  originally a military watch tower maintained by the Dutch
		  upon which  beacon fires were lighted.&nbsp; The existing  light was
		  erected by  the Dutch upon which beacon fires were lighted.</p>
		<p> The existing  light was erected in 1865, and is placed at a
		  height of 65  feet above high water in latitude 33 degrees
		  54.1' S,  longitude 18 degrees 24.1' E and has a range of 13
		  3/4  miles.&nbsp; The tower is square in plan and  built of masonry.</p>
		<p> It is 52 feet  from ground level to the balcony.&nbsp; The  upper 20
		  feet were  added when the present light was erected.&nbsp;  The
		  lantern is  circular in plan with a cast iron murette, flat
		  glazing and  vertical and horizontal framing.&nbsp; The  double
		  lined copper  dome has a perforated ball-shaped ventilator.</p>
		<p> The optical  apparatus is dioptric of the third order of 500
		  m/m focal  radius and consists of 8 revolving panels with
		  upper and  lower refracting zones.&nbsp; Each panel  produces a
		  white flash  once in 10 seconds, thus one complete revolution
		  comprising 8  flashes is performed in 80 seconds.&nbsp; The
		  apparatus  when erected was provided with a 2 wick Trinity
		  House pattern  burner and had a power of 8,500 candles, the
		  revolving  lenses being carried on vertical steel rollers.</p>
		<p> Owing to the  worn condition of the machine and revolving
		  carriage it  became necessary to provide new gear in 1906.</p>
		<p> The  opportunity was then taken to do away with the old and
		  cumbersome  rollers and a modern mercury floating apparatus
		  was  installed.&nbsp; With this apparatus the whole  of the
		  revolving  portions weighing some 3 1/2 tons is actually
		  floated  mercury, the weight of which is 4 1/2 cwts.&nbsp;  The
		  revolving  portions are actuated by a weight driven clock with
		  a suspended  driving weight of 125 lbs.&nbsp; At the same  time to 2
		  wick burner  was replaced by an incandescent oil vapour burner
		  with a mantle  of 55 m/m diameter.&nbsp; The use of  incandescent
		  illumination  has increased the power of the flash to 50,000
		  candles.</p>
		<p> Green Point  Lighthouse is the headquarters of the Lighthouse
		  Relieving  Staff, is a training station, and has a workshop at
		  which all mechanical  repairs and adjustments of apparatus and
		  burners are  made for the whole of the lighthouses by the
		  light keeping  staff.</p>
	<p><strong>CAPE POINT</strong></p>
		<p> This  lighthouse is situated on one of the most beautiful
		  portions of  the coast.&nbsp; It is erected on the point at  an
		  elevation of  nearly 800 feet above the sea.&nbsp;&nbsp; The  focal plane
		  of the light  is actually 816 feet above high water, and the
		  beam is  visible in very clear weather at a distance of 36
		  miles.&nbsp; The light has a visual arc of 331 degrees 52.5'  of
    which 5  degrees 37.5' is obscured by Vasco de Gama's Peak.</p>
		<p> Being at such  an unusual height, the light is very frequently
		  obscured by  passing clouds and mist, the average yearly
		  obscuration  being 900 hours, which is only equalled at sea
    level on the  foggy shores of Newfoundland.</p>
		<p> The tower  which is circular in plan is naturally of small
		  height, only  30 feet from the ground level of balcony, and is
		  constructed  of cast iron segments bolted together.&nbsp;  The light
		  is of antique  pattern, a first order catoptric apparatus
		  showing a  flash of 12 seconds duration every minute.&nbsp;  The
		  burners are  of the one wick &quot;Deville&quot; constant level type,
		  and, in  conjunction with the parabolic reflectors, emit which
		  includes the  provision of a modern and powerful first order
		  light at a  low level Diaz Point about 3/4 of a mile from the
		  existing  light on Cape Point.&nbsp; The poposed light  will have a
		  power of over  400,000 candles, and would be a level out of
		  the range of  frequent cloud obscuration, which so impairs the
		  efficiency of  the existing light.&nbsp; Owing, however, to  the
		  nature of the  coast this light cannot be provided until the
    proposed new  light for Slangkop has been erected.</p>
		<p> Cape Point is  a Lloyd's signalling station and is connected
    with  Simonstown by telephone.</p>
		<p> Provisions  are conveyed once in every three months by ox-waggon, and a  weekly post carried on donkeys is provided.</p>
		<p> At this stage  mention should be made of the Lighthouses
		  Commission  which sat in 1906.&nbsp; The following  schemes,
    prepared by  the Author were then recommended:-</p>
		<p> The provision  of a first order light and compressed air syren
    at Slangkop  at an estimated cost of about &oelig;&Agrave;16,000.</p>
		<p> The building  of a first order light on a lower site at Cape
		  Point costing  &oelig;&Agrave;7,500.<br />
		  The existing  light at Roman Rock to be replaced by a third
		  order  flashing light.<br />
		  The provision  of a new tower and first order flashing light
		  at Cape  L'Agulhas at a cost of &oelig;&Agrave;10,600.<br />
		  At Amandu  Point near the Bashee River the erection of a first
    order  flashing light costing &oelig;&Agrave;15,000.</p>
		<p> At Port  Nolloth the erection of a fourth order light and an
		  explosive fog  signal.</p>
	<p> This for  signal has since been erected.</p>
		<p> At Cape ST  Blaize, Mossel Bay, the installation of an
		  explosive fog  signal.
		  And at Dassen  Island and provision of a compressed air fog
    syren.</p>
		<p> Unfortunately  the financial condition of the Colony has
		  interfered  with carrying out of most of these much needed
    improvements  to the coast lighting.</p>
		<p> Proceeding,  the next light is ROMAN ROCK in Simon's Bay.</p>
		<p> This light  was established in 1845, and is the only rock
		  lighthouse on  the coast of Cape Colony.&nbsp; It is erected  on the
		  summit of a  rock pinnacle rising out of the sea at the
		  entrance to  Simon's Bay.&nbsp; The rock is awash at low  water of
		  spring tides,  and that only in exceptionally calm weather; it
		  is therefore  easy to picture the many difficulties that had
		  to be  overcome during the construction of the tower.&nbsp;  It is
		  situated in  latitude 34 degrees 10.7' S longitude 18 degrees
    27.5' E and  is about two and a half miles from the Mainland.</p>
		<p> The tower is  circular in plan and is formed of cast iron
		  segments  bolted together, the lowest ring being secured to
		  the  rock.&nbsp; Some time after the construction  of the tower was
		  completed,  unmistakable signs of collapse appeared which were
		  due to the  constantly recurring shocks from sea strokes in
		  stormy  weather.&nbsp; In order to give additional  weight to the
		  structure and  increase its stability and resistance to the
		  sea strokes,  a granite base was constructed completely
		  surrounding  the lower part of the tower to a height of 20
		  feet.&nbsp; This addition has had the desired effect of  making the
    structure  capable of withstanding the heaviest seas.</p>
		<p> The height of  the tower from rock level to balcony is 45
		  feet, the  focal plane of the light being 54 feet above high
    water and the  range 12 miles.</p>
		<p> The light is  of the catoptric type and similar to that of
		  Cape Point,  with the exception that only one reflector is
		  visible at a  time, thereby reducing the candle power of beams
		  to a fourth  of that of Cape Point where four reflectors
		  arranged in  every face.&nbsp; The flash occurs once in 30  seconds,
		  tyhe system  of 8 reflectors making a complete revolution in 4
    minutes.</p>
		<p> Communication  by day with Simonstown is effected by flag
		  signalling,  whilst at night coloured lights are used in cases
		  of  emergency.&nbsp; It, however, frequently  happens that owing to
		  stormy  weather the men have to remain in the tower for
		  several days  before they can be relieved, and during these
		  storms the  waves break with such force as to drive the crests
		  and broken  water over the lanter.&nbsp; On such occasions  it is of
    course  impossible for the men to emerge from tower.</p>
	<p><strong> POINT DANGER  LIGHT</strong></p>
		<p> This light,  established in 1895, overlooks the spot where the
		  world-famous  wreck of the BIRKENHEAD occurred, and is
		  situated in  latitude 34 degrees 37.8' S, longitude 19 degrees
		  The tower, which  is 60 feet in height to the lantern floor
    level, is  octagonal in plan and is constructed of concrete.</p>
		<p> the range of  the light is 18 miles, the focal plane being 150
		  feet above  high water.&nbsp; The lantern, circular in  plan, is 12
		  feet in  internal diamteter with cast iron murette, circular
		  glazing and  rectangualr framing, with a double lined dome and
    Trinity House  pattern ventilator.</p>
		<p> The apparatus  consist of a first order dioptric triple
		  flashing  optic of 920 m/m focal radius, showing a white
		  light, the  characteristic of which is as follows:-</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p> Flash&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.25 seconds<br />
		    Eclipse&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.75 seconds<br />
		    Flash&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.25 seconds<br />
		    Eclipse&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.75 seconds<br />
		    Flash&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.25 seconds<br />
		    Eclipse&nbsp; 25.75 seconds<br />
		    ______________________<br />
		    Total&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 40 seconds<br />
		    [G 33-1910]</p>
	    </blockquote>
		<p> The optic  contains 4 panels of 27 degrees and 8 panels of 31
		  1/2 degrees  and wighs about 3 1/2 tons.&nbsp; It revolves  on 8
		  vertical  steel rollers and is guided horizontally by 16
		  gunmetal.&nbsp; One revolution of the apparatus is made in 2
		  minutes, 40  seconds, comprising four complete periods.&nbsp;  The
		  driving clock  is weight driven, the falling weight being 6
		  cwts.  suspended on a 9/16 in chain.&nbsp; It is  fitted with a&quot;Slight&quot;  centrifugal governor and dial gear indicating the
speed.</p>
		<p> Hand turning  gear is also provided for emergency use.&nbsp;  The
		  illuminant is  a 6 wick Trinity House Douglass burner, fed
		  from two 50  gallon Trinity House pump reservoirs.&nbsp;  The
		  intensity of  the beam thrown from the optic is 45,000
		  candles, and  the annual consumption of heavy mineral oil is
		  1,800  gallons.&nbsp; Incandescent oil vapour burners  of the most
		  modern type  are now about to be installed in place of the
		  existing wick  burners.&nbsp; This substitution will increase  the
		  candle power  of the light by over 400 percent and result in
		  about 40  percent economy of oil.</p>
		<p><strong> CAPE  L'AGULHAS LIGHTHOUSE</strong></p>
		<p> Cape  L'Agulhas, the most Southerly point of Africa, is on the
		  theoretical  dividing lines of two oceans.&nbsp; It is one  of the
		  most  important landfalls to mariners, and yet until recently
		  it has been  perhaps the least efficiently lighted headland on
		  our coast.&nbsp; The fact of its great importance to  navigation is
		  shewn by the  date of the first establishment of a light on
		  the Cape in  1848.&nbsp; The optical apparatus originally  installed
		  has existed  unaltered in its form until the present year, and
		  its great  life makes it of considerable interest.&nbsp;  It was one
		  of the very  early diptric fixed lenses constructed in France,
		  and a very  similar example the Author has seen installed in
		  the Museum of  the Depot des Phares at Paris.&nbsp; The  apparatus
		  was of the  first order and cata-diptric consisting of a fixed
		  cylindrical  glass refractor of 920 m/m focal distance with a
		  slivered  metallic reflector and two sets of upper and lower
		  reflecting  silvered mirrors fitted one above the other below
		  the  refracting belt.&nbsp; Until 1905 the illumination  employed
		  was that  given by a four wick Trinity House burner, the
		  resultant  power to the beam from the optic being a trifle
		  over 4,000  candles.</p>
		<p> In every  early years oil manufactured from the tails of Cape
		  sheep,  costing about 10s per gallon was used at this
		  lighthouse,  but by the adoption of the modern incandescent
		  oil vapour  burner consuming mineral oil the power of the
		  light was  increased to 17,000 candles.</p>
		<p> The tower is  circular in plan, 63&nbsp; feet in height and  is
		  built of  limestone, surmounted by a polygonal lantern with
		  flat glazing  and rectangular framing.&nbsp; The focal place  of the
		  light is 128  feet above high water.&nbsp; A scheme was  prepared by
		  the Author in  1906 to construct a new tower of reinforced
		  concrete on  an adjoining site; the height of the poposed
		  tower would  have been sufficient to give an elevation of 180
		  feet to the  focal plane of the light.&nbsp; The estimated  cost of
		  this scheme  was &oelig;&Agrave;10,600 and included the provision of a new
		  lighting  apparatus and lanter.</p>
		<p> Financial  reasons have prevented the carrying out of this
		  scheme in its  entirety, but a modification including the
		  provision of  a modern first order flashing light utilizing
		  the existing  tower and lantern, involving the expenditure of
		  4,000 was  sanctioned by the Government in 1908.&nbsp;  This scheme
		  has recently  been completed.&nbsp; The new apparatus  consists of 4
		  panels, each  panel subtending a vertical angle of 126 degrees
		  and a  horizontal angle of 90 degrees.&nbsp; The lens  consists of 4
		  bulls'-eyes  with 8 annular rings, the remainder of the
		  optical elements  being cata-diotric prisms.&nbsp; The frames  are
		  of gun-metal  and carry the entire weight of the lenses, some
		  6 tons.</p>
		<p> The optic  rotates on a mercury float and makes a revolution
		  in 12  seconds, the weight of the revolving portions being
		  about 8 tons.</p>
		<p> The mercury  bath and float are of cast iron, and are arranged
		  for lowering  for inspection and cleaning purposes.&nbsp;  The bath
		  is carried on  an annular table with screwed sleeve
		  surrounding  the shaft of the pedestal.&nbsp; An aperture  is left
		  in the table  to give access to the interior of the optic.</p>
		<p> The apparatus  and float are maintained in a perfectly central
		  position by  means of guide rollers.&nbsp; Subsidiary steel  rollers
		  with ball  bearings are provided for taking the weight of
		  apparatus  when the mercury has been run out.&nbsp; The  apparatus
		  is rotated by  means of a weigh-driven clock which is hand
		  wound, the  weight about 400 lbs, being suspended on a
		  flexible  steel cable.&nbsp; The clock is fitted with a  &quot;Slight&quot;
		  governor, and  has an electrical speed warning apparatus
		  ringing a bell  in the lantern.&nbsp; In addition the electric  bell
		  attached to  the clock is interconected with the top and
		  bottom of the  weight tube indicating when the weight required
		  re-winding  and when it is high enough.<br />
		  The  illuminant is a modern petroleum vapour incandescent
		  burner  carrying three mantles each of 55 m/m diameter and
		  giving a  power to the beam of the light of 470,000 candles.</p>
		<p> Owing to the  heavy nature of some of the castings, one of
		  which weighed  27 cwts. the work of erection was somewhat
		  difficult,  added to this was the necessity of installing the
		  apparatus  without interfering with the existing lantern with
		  a resulting  loss of space in which to manoeuvre the castings.</p>
		<p> The method of  hoisting the portions was as follows:-</p>
		<p> A spar of  pitch pine about 30 feet long and 12 inches in
		  diameter  tapered at the end was erected on top of the tower
		  and stayed  with flexible steel wires to anchors let into the
		  ground.&nbsp; A wire rope gear consisting of single and  double
		  iron blocks  was led from the winch through a snatch block to
		  the derrick  head.&nbsp; The castings were then hoisted  high enough
		  to clear the  tower balcony (some 63 feet) the derrick topped
		  and the  castings finally landed on the balcony.&nbsp;  The castings
		  were then  dragged along the balcony and passed through an
		  aperture made  in the granite base of the lanter.&nbsp; Once  inside
		  the castings  were each lifted into position by means of a
		  derrick and  two Westinghouse purchases.</p>
		<p> For the  passage of the steel driving cable a hole 4 feet 6
		  inches in  depth was drilled through the granite floor of the
		  lantern.</p>
		<p> The weight  tube measuring 60 feet in height and 18 inches in
		  diameter and  weighing 24 cwts., was put together inside the
		  tower, the  bottom portion being sunk into a hole cut out of
		  the  foundations of the tower and passed through each floor
		  and finally  jacked up into position and the hole concreted.</p>
		<p> With the  exception of unskilled labour the Author erected
		  this  apparatus with the help of the lightkeeper, his
		  assistant and  two relieving lightkeepers.</p>
		<p> During the  progress of the work a temporary light made in the
		  workshop at  Green POint LIghthouse, was exhibited.</p>
		<p> The new light  exhibits a flash once in 3 seconds and has a
		  range of 81  miles.</p>
		<p><strong>CAPE ST  BLAIZE</strong></p>
		<p> This light  was established in 1864 when a third order fixed
		  red light was  erected on the headland which separates Mossel
		  Bay from Fish  Bay in latitude 34 degrees 11.2'S, longitude 22
		  degrees 9.5'  E.&nbsp; The focal plane is 240 feet above  high
		  water, and  the light has a range of 15 miles.&nbsp; The  tower
		  which is of  masonry, is square in plan.&nbsp; The existing
		  apparatus was  erected in 1897, the old tower being utilized
		  for its  reception and a new lantern 8 feet internal diameter
		  was provided  at the same time.&nbsp; The optical apparatus  is a
		  4th order  dioptric double flashing white light of 250 m/m
		  focal  distance exhibiting two flashes in rapid succession
		  every 15  seconds.&nbsp; The optic is a bivalve, each  lens being
		  subdivided  into two panels.&nbsp; The driving clock is  actuated by
		  a weight of  150 lbs. and regulated by a horizontal disc
		  governor.&nbsp; The burner is of the 1 wick Trinity House  Douglass
    type and is  fed from a constant level oil rervoir.</p>
		<p> The power of  the beam is 4,500 candles.&nbsp; Cape St  Blaize is a
		  signalling  station, and is the telephonic communication with
    the office of  the Harbour Master of Mossel Bay.</p>
	<p><strong> CAPE ST  FRANCIS</strong></p>
		<p> This station  was built in 1878 and is in latitude 34 degrees
		  12.5'  longitude 24 degrees 50.3' E. and about 45 miles.&nbsp; West
		  of Port  Elizabeth.&nbsp; The focal plane of the light  is 118 feet
		  above high  water.&nbsp; The beam is visible for 16 3/4  miles, and
    has a white  arc of 225 deg. and a red arc of 53 degrees 26'.</p>
		<p> The tower is  91 feet in height from ground level to balcony
		  is circular  in plan and is built of masonry with a 15 foot
		  granite base  and balcony.&nbsp; As showing the unusual  thickness
		  of the walls  of the tower it may be mentioned that a circular
		  staircase is  constructed in the thickness of the wall for a
		  height of 40  feet.&nbsp; The lanter pedestal is of cast  iron
		  surmounted by  flat glazing and inclined framing capped by a
		  double copper  cupola with a perforated ball shaped
    ventilator.</p>
		<p> The diptric  flashing apparatus is of the second order,
		  consisting of  8 lenses with upper and lower refracting
		  prisms,  shewing a single white flashing light.&nbsp;  Until 1906
		  the revolving  optic was carried upon a set of vertical steel
		  rollers, but  the driving machine and revolving carriage being
		  in an  unreliable condition owing to excessive wear, it became
		  necessary to  renew the mechanism and advantage was taken of
		  the  opportunity to substitute the modern system of mercury
		  rotation for  the old roller carriage.&nbsp; At the same  time the
		  speed of  revolution was accelerated from one flash in 20
		  seconds to  one in five seconds, the total revolution being
		  completed in  40 seconds.&nbsp; The entire revolving  portions of
		  the apparatus  weighing some 4 1/2 tons are now carried on a
		  cast iron  annular float revolving in a bath.&nbsp; The  driving
		  machine is  actuated by a weight of only 60 lbs., suspended on
    a flexible  steel cable and regulated by a &quot;Sight&quot; governor.</p>
		<p> Simultaneously  with the provision of these improvements the
		  power of the  light was increased from 15,000 candles to
		  120,000  candles by the substitution of 85 m/m diameter
		  incandescent  oil vapour burner, for the 3 wick burner
		  formerly in  use.&nbsp; Communication with Humansdorp by  day and
		  Port Elizabeth  by night is maintained by telephone.&nbsp; The
		  lighthouse is  a Lloyds' signalling station and is manned by a
		  lightkeeper  and two assistants.&nbsp; The total cost of  the
    original  building and improvements to date has been &oelig;&Agrave;27,000.</p>
		<p><strong> CAPE RECEIFFE</strong></p>
		<p> This station,  established in 1851, is placed on the Cape
		  which forms  the western horn of Algoa Bay, overlooking the
		  Thunderbolt  Reef, in latitude 34 degrees 1.7' S, longitude 25
		  degrees 42.2'  E.&nbsp; The tower is built on a rock  foundation in
		  the midst of  a large expanse of sand beach.&nbsp; At high  water
		  spring tides  during heavy weather with wind from the N.W, the
		  sea comes  right round the lighthouse and isolates it from the
		  mainland.&nbsp; The focal plane of the light is 93 feet above  high
		  water and it  has a range of 15 miles.&nbsp; The light shows  red
		  through an  arc of 28 degrees 8' over the Roman Rock and white
    through the  remainder of the seward arc of 244 degrees 41'.</p>
		<p> The tower is  constructed of masonry, is octagonal in plan,
    and has a  height of 80 ft.&nbsp; from ground level to  balcony.</p>
		<p> The pedestal  of the lantern is also of masonry and is
    surmounted by  polygonal flat glazing in rectangular framing.</p>
		<p> The copper  dome is double lined and has a Trinity House
		  pattern  ventilator.&nbsp; The optic is of the first  order and
		  consists of a  fixed and flashing diptric apparatus.&nbsp;  The
		  flashing  portion is made up of 8 panels of lenses of 920 m/m
		  focal radius,  revolving on a set of 8 vertical steel rollers
    and guided by  2 sets of 6 each of brass horizontal rollers.</p>
		<p> A white flash  is emitted once in every 60 seconds and a
		  revolution of  the apparatus once in 8 minutes.&nbsp; The  fixed
		  light is  produced by upper and lower belts and refractory
		  prisms.&nbsp; The driving machine, which is of French  manufacture,
		  is actuated  by a suspended weight and regulated by a fan
		  governor.&nbsp; In 1905 the power&nbsp; of light was increased from
		  20,000 to  125,000 candles by the substitution of an 85 m/m
		  incandescent  oil vapour for the 4 wick Trinity House pattern
		  burner then  is use.&nbsp; Cape Receiffe is also a Lloyd's
		  signalling  station, and is in telephonic communication with
    the Port  Elizabeth Lighthouse.</p>
	<p><strong> PORT  ELIZABETH</strong></p>
		<p> This  lighthouse is situated in the middle of Donkins Reserve,
		  Port  Elizabeth, in latitude 33 degrees 57.7' S, longitude 25
		  degrees 37'  E, the light having a range of 12 miles.&nbsp;  The
		  tower and  lantern are octagonal in plan and are both of
    brickwork.&nbsp; The lantern glazing is of flat rectangular  panes.</p>
		<p> Until 1903  the apparatus in use was a fourth order fixed
		  lens, and a  wick burner.&nbsp; In that year the old fixed  light
		  was  superseded by a fourth order dioptric occulting light of
		  250 m/m focal  radius, with a red arc flanking the white arc
    on either  side.</p>
		<p> The optic  consists of a diptric belt, 6 refracting rings and
		  9 reflecting  prisms with an illuminated arc of 136 degrees,
		  the remainder  of the light being utilized for strengthening
		  the red arcs  by means of (1) a totally reflecting dioptric
		  mirror of 250  m/m focal distance, subtending a vertical
		  angle of 66  degrees and a total horizontal angle of 140
		  degrees, and  (2) azumuthal or vertical condensing prisms in
		  two sets  carried to the full height of the apparatus.&nbsp;  The
		  characteristic  of the light is 3 seconds eclipse every 10
		  seconds and  is produced by means of a cylindrical aluminium
		  shutter  ascending and descending over the burner, the
		  movement  being obtained from an eccentric cam fitted to the
		  driving  machine.&nbsp; The occulting gear is  clock-driven, the
		  weights being  suspended from a steel cable.&nbsp; The  burners are
		  of the  incandescent oil vapour type with a mantle of 55 m/m
    diameter, the  intensity of the beam being 12,500 candles.</p>
		<p> This station  is in telephonic communication with Cape St
		  Francis and  Cape Receiffe Lighthouses and the Telephone
		  Exchange of  Port Elizabeth, and is manned by a lightkeeper
		  and one  assistant.&nbsp; Homing pigeons are kept here  for use in
    maintaining  communication with Bird Island Lighthouse.</p>
		<p> Meteorological  observations are taken regularly and a time
		  ball is  dropped by an electrical apparatus released from the
    observatory.&nbsp; Ann anemometer is also fitted at this  station.</p>
	<p><strong> BIRD ISLAND</strong></p>
		<p> This island  near the Eastern limit of Algoa Bay was first
		  provided with  a light in 1852, when two wooden towers, each
		  carrying a  fixed light, were erected 18 feet apart.&nbsp;  One
		  light being  10 feet higher than the other, two lights whn in
		  line gave a  bearing over the Doddington Rock.&nbsp; One  can easily
		  picture the  anxiety of the mariner on the look-out for these
		  feeble lights  in dirty weather.&nbsp; In 1873, a second  order
		  fixed diptric  red light was erected on a massive square tower
		  of masonry,  and constituted a marked improvement upon the old
		  lowe power  double lights.&nbsp; But even this improvement
		  ultimately  failed to meet the demands of modern shipping, and
		  constituted a  marked improvement upon the old low power
		  double  shipping, and in 1893 the third light to be
		  established  on Bird Island was erected, an additional 25 feet
		  height of  masonry being added to the tower to give the light
		  an increase  elevation.&nbsp; The light has a range of 16  miles,
		  the focal  plane being 100 feet above high water, and is
		  visible all  round the horizon.&nbsp; The position of the  light is
    latitude 33  degrees 50.4' S, longitude 26 degrees 17.2' E.</p>
		<p> The lanter,  erected in 1893, has a cast iron murette and
		  curved  glazing in rectangular framing.&nbsp; The  illuminating
		  apparatus is  dioptric and consists of a first order double
		  flashing  optic of 920 m/m focal radius, having 4 sides each
    subdivided  and producing two white flashes of 3 seconds each.</p>
		<p> The  characteristic of the light is as follows:-</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p> Flash&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 seconds<br />
		    Eclipse&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4 seconds<br />
		    Flash&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 seconds<br />
		    Eclipse&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;20  seconds<br />
		    _______________________<br />
		    Total period  30 seconds</p>
	    </blockquote>
		<p> The  revolution of the optic is performed in 120 seconds and
		  embraces 4  complete periods.&nbsp; The lens and table are  carried
		  on a set of  vertical steel rollers guided by 2 sets of
		  horizontal  brass rollers.&nbsp; The power of the beam is  at
		  present  47,000 candles, but this will shortly be increased to
		  180, 000  candles by the introduction of incandescent oil
    vapour  burners.</p>
		<p> The existing  burners are of the 6-wick Trinity House Douglass
		  type.&nbsp; The burner is fed by 2 fifty gallon Trinity  House
    pattern pump  lamps.</p>
		<p> Meteorological  observations are recorded at this station, but
		  the only  communication with the mainland which is available
		  at present is  by the employment of homing pigeons.&nbsp; A  relief
		  tug with  stores proceeds to Bird Island from Port Elizabeth
    once in each  mouth.</p>
		<p> Emergency  stores for shipwerecked mariners are kept in sealed
		  drums at this  station.</p>
	<p><strong> GREAT FISH  POINT</strong></p>
		<p> This  lighthouse is a comparatively recent erection, dating
		  from 1898,  when it was built to supersede the old fixed red
		  light  formerly exhibited at Port Alfred.&nbsp; As no  shipping now
		  enters or  leaves the Port, the necessity for maintaining a
    light at Port  Alfred ceases to exist.</p>
		<p> The light is  situated on the crest of a sand hill about half
		  a mile inland  or northward of Great Fish Point, and about 2
		  miles from  the mouth of the Great Fish River, in latitude 33
		  degrees 21.2'  S, longitude 27 degrees 6.6' E.&nbsp; The  light is
		  visible over  an arc of water.&nbsp; The tower is  octagonally
		  constructed  of concrete and is about 30 feet high.&nbsp;  The
		  lantern has a  cast iron murette and curved glazing.&nbsp;  The
		  optical  apparatus is a first order dioptric single flashing
		  bivalve of  920 m/m focal radius.&nbsp; One white flash of
		  2/5 seconds  duration occurs every 10 seconds, the revolution
		  being tons  revolve over a bath of mercury.&nbsp; A set of
		  horizontal  brass guide rollers is provided as well as 3
		  vertical  steel screwjacks for lifting the apparatus to enable
		  the mercury  bath to be cleaned.&nbsp; The light when first  erected
		  was fitted  with a 6-wick Trinity House burner, giving a power 
		  of 145,000  candles to the beam.&nbsp; The burner was fed  by means
		  of two  12-gallon Chance pressure lamps.&nbsp; In  1908, the Author
		  installed a  vapourized oil burner with an incande4scent
		  mantle of 85  m/m diameter, increasing the intensity of the
		  beam to  600,000 candles and effecting a saving in cost of oil
		  of &oelig;&Agrave;120 per  annum.&nbsp; The revolving apparatus is driven  by
		  clockwork,  actuated by a set of weights suspended on a 9/16-
		  inch chain  and regulated by means of a &quot;Sight&quot; governor.&nbsp; It
		  is fitted  with a speed indicator and hand gear for turning
    the optic in  case of derangement of the driving machine.</p>
		<p><strong> HOOD POINT  LIGHTHOUS</strong></p>
		<p> This station  was established in 1895, and is situated on the
		  WEst Bank and  near the mouth of the Buffalo River at East
		  London in  latitude 33 degrees 2.3' S, longitude 27 degrees
		  54' E.&nbsp; The tower is 32 feet in height from ground to  balcony
		  level and the  focal plane of the apparatus is 180 feet above
		  high water,  giving the light a range of 20 miles with a
    visual arc of  174 degrees 22.5'.</p>
		<p> The lantern  is circular in plan with a cast iron murette and
		  curved  glazing.&nbsp; The dome and ventilator arc of  the usual
		  modern type  previously described. The dioptric  apparatus is
		  of the first  order of 920 m/m focal distance, showing a group
    of four white  flashes every 40 seconds as follows:-</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p> Flash 1/2 second<br />
		    Eclipse 4 1/4 second<br />
		    Flash 1/2 second<br />
		    Eclipse 4 1/2 second<br />
		    Flash 1/2 second<br />
		    Eclipse 4 1/2 second<br />
		    Flash 1/2 second<br />
		    Eclipse 25 1/4 second</p>
	      <hr align="left" width="120" />
          Total period  40 second</blockquote>
		<p> The optic  consists of 4 panels of lenses each lens subtending
		  45 degrees in  azimuth, with a totally reflecting prismoidal
		  mirror of 180  degrees and revolves over a mercury bath.&nbsp;  An
		  axialsteel  shaft retains the revolving apparatus in true
		  position, and  two sets of ball bearings are provided to take
    the weight of  the lens and table when the mercury is run off.</p>
		<p> The driving  machine is weight driven and regulated by a&quot;<em>Slight</em>&quot;  governor with speed indicator and hand turning gear
		  for emergency  use.&nbsp; The burners are of the Trinity  House
		  Douglass type  with 5 wicks, the diameter of the outer wick
		  being the  same as that of the outer wick in the old 6-wick
		  burner, and  is fed by two 50-gallon Trinity House pressure
		  reservoirs.&nbsp; An incandescent oil vapour burner will  shortly
		  replace the  wick burner when the power of the light will be
		  increased to  312,000 candles.&nbsp; Anemometer records are  taken</p>
		<p><strong> CAPE HERMES  LIGHTHOUSE</strong></p>
		<p> This station  was built by the Author in 1906, and is situated
		  on a headland  at the entrance to the St John's or Umzimvubu
		  River.&nbsp; It is the most northerly light on the coast  of the
		  Cape  Colony.&nbsp; The focal plane of the light is  175 feet above
		  high water  and the range is 19 1/2 miles.&nbsp; The tower  is
		  octagonal and  is built of a dark grey dolerite, quarried on
		  the  site.&nbsp; The lantern balcony is of concrete  reinforced with
		  old steel  rails.&nbsp; The lantern is circular with a  cast iron
		  murette,  vertical framing and curved glazing and surmounted
		  by a single  sheeted copper dome and modern ventilator.&nbsp;The
		  dioptric  apparatus is three sided of the fourth order and 250
		  m/m focal  radius, exhibiting a single flashing white light.</p>
		<p> The lens  revolves over a mercury bath and a set of upper and
		  lower ball  bearings is provided for sbusidiary use.</p>
		<p> Access to the  inside of the float and bath is obtained by
		  lowering the  bath on a spirally grooved shaft which forms the
		  pedestal.&nbsp; The driving clock is actuated by weights  suspended
		  on a steel  cable and is regulated with the usual &quot;<em>Sight</em>&quot;
		  governor,  with dial speed indicator and emergency hand
		  turning  gear.&nbsp; The burner is of the incandescent  oil vapour
		  type with a  mantle of 55 m/m diameter, giving a power to the
		  beam of  30,000 candles.</p>
		<p> Considerable  difficulty is experienced in dealing with
		  extensive  landslips which occur at the site of and along the
		  approach road  to the lighthouse.&nbsp; The formation of the  hill
		  in which the  excavations for the foundation were made in
		  loose gravel  with huge dolerite boulders embedded therein.</p>
		<p> In heavy rain  the loose material is coured out and a mud rush
		  bringing  enormous boulders with it, frequently results.</p>
		<p> In conclusion  the Author would like to state that contrary to
		  the opinion  expressed by the public in connection with recent
		  wrecks, the  coast of Cape Colony with the exception of a few
		  lights, is  lit by a class of lighthouse that is quite up to
		  the most  modern types used in Europe.&nbsp; When the  additions and
		  improvements  recommended by the Lighthouses Commission of
		  1906 have  been carried out, the coast of Cape Colony will be
		  as well lit as  any coast in the world.</p>
