		<p><strong>V</strong></p>
		<p>VAJRASANA. (Indian). &quot;Vajra-seat.&quot;  The seat of enlightenment under the bodhi tree. Also, the seat, or  altar, presently beneath the bodhi tree at Bodh Gaya is known as vajrasana.  The term also refers to a throne or seat that has a vajra upon it or to padmasana,  the sitting posture. Some authorities, however, contend that there are  differences between the vajrasana, vajraparyankasana, and padmasana  postures.</p>
		<p> VALLEY. The intersection between two sloping  roof surfaces, towards which the water flows. This is obviously the opposite of  a roof hip which sheds water from it. (Afrikaans: kiel).</p>
		<p> VANE. Also known as a Fane; a plate of metal,  often ornamented, turning on a vertical spindle so as to show the direction of  the wind, frequently fixed on the tops of spires and pinnacles.&nbsp; It is often in the form of a cock and hence  is very commonly called a weather-cock or a wind vane. (Afrikaans: weerhaan).</p>
		<p> VAV. (Indian). Also wav. A step-well.</p>
		<p> Vastera. (isiXhosa). A window, also known as ifestile.  Derived from the Afrikaans venster.</p>
		<p> VEDI. (Indian). An altar; an altar-stand or  pedestal.</p>
		<p> VEDIKA. (Indian). A railing enclosing a sacred caitya,  or a spot or object of veneration.</p>
		<p> VENDA. Indigenous group inhabiting the northern  Transvaal in an area bordering with eastern Zimbabwe. The people are more  correctly known as the vhaVenda and their language is referred to as tshiVenda.</p>
		<p> VENDA ARCHITECTURE. The domestic architecture of Venda is  perhaps best noted for its broad eaves, often supported by verandah posts  running the full perimeter of a cone on cylinder dwelling and the use of stone  in the construction of fortified villages for local chiefs and headmen. Wall  decorations painted by women feature strongly on the perimeter walls of their  homesteads which differ markedly from the circular pattern predominant  throughout the rest of southern Africa.</p>
		<p> VENSTERBANK. (Afrikaans). See under WINDOW CILL.</p>
		<p> VERANDAH. An open gallery or balcony attached to a  house or building, its roof usually supported by a light structure of timber or  cast iron. (Afrikaans: stoep).</p>
		<p> VERANDAH DWELLING. Generic term used to describe any  dwelling with an attached verandah. This may be a partial verandah, covering  one or more facades of a building, or a full verandah, as in the case of the  cone on cylinder, where it runs the full perimeter of the structure.</p>
		<p> VERGE. See under BARGE. (Afrikaans: gewelrand).</p>
		<p> VERSPANNER. (Afrikaans). See under BRACE.</p>
		<p> VESARA. (Indian). A mule or a hybrid. The name  of a style of architecture believed to be associated with the Deccan region.</p>
		<p> Vhoti. (tshiVenda). A door.</p>
		<p> VICTORIAN  ARCHITECTURE.  Although the Victorian era was typified by an exuberant and richly textured  architecture, much of this character relied upon the use of applied decoration.  At first it largely took the form of fretted timber work, used in verandah  trims, barge boards, gable finials and loft ventilators but the subsequent  availability of mass produced cast iron work also gave added richness to roof  lines and verandahs. Although there was an initial tendency to modernise  previous Cape Dutch and Georgian dwellings by the addition of front and rear  verandahs, a wide range of domestic and public buildings were also erected.  Their style is better known for its eclecticism, including elements freely  drawn from such varied sources as Medieval Gothic, Italian Romanesque and  Byzantine traditions. Wide use was also made of ornamented chimneys, bay  windows, sash timber frames, roof-ventilators and patterned brickwork,  particularly after the 1870s and the discovery of diamonds and gold deposits in  the southern African interior.
	    VIHARA. (Indian). A monastery; may be either  free-standing or rock-cut.</p>
		<p> VIMANA. (Indian). The shrine portion of a temple  and its superstructure.</p>
		<p> VINKKAP. (Afrikaans). See under FINK TRUSS.</p>
		<p> VLOERBALK. (Afrikaans). See under FLOOR JOIST.</p>
		<p> VOORHUIS. (Afrikaans). From the Dutch, meaning front  house or entrance room. See VOORKAMER.</p>
		<p> VOORKAMER. From the Dutch, meaning front room. Term  used to denote the entrance hall and main reception area of a Cape Dutch  dwelling.</p>
		<p> VOORTREKKER WAGON. See under KAKEBEENWA.</p>
		<p> VORMKLIP. (Afrikaans). See under ASHLAR.</p>
