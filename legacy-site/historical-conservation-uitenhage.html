        <h5>CONSERVING UITENHAGE</h5>
        <p align="left">Franco Frescura and Albrecht Herholdt</p>
        <h5>INTRODUCTION</h5>
        <p>Despite what many of its detractors tend to claim, a policy of  architectural conservation is not concerned so much with the restoration of old  buildings as it is with the preservation of a quality of life for their  inhabitants. Most architectural historians are in general agreement with the  claim that the built environment is a reliable yardstick of a people's cultural  values and most laymen tend to judge a town by the charm and character of its  buildings. We can therefore begin to understand the concern expressed by the  Uitenhage 200 Committee at its inaugural meeting in September 1985 when they  reviewed the long list of historical landmarks which had been lost to future  generations through demolitions in the town since 1965, and the quality of the  buildings which had replaced them since. It was felt that, at this current rate  of development, few if any buildings of historical merit would be left in  Uitenhage by the time it celebrated its bi-centennial in 2004.</p>
        <p>Yet the story of Uitenhage is the story of most small towns on the  southern African platteland where the trimmings and symbols of a more gracious  and bygone era are being lost daily through neglect, ignorance or a simple desire  for change for change's sake.</p>
        <p>Uitenhage is perhaps more fortunate than most in that it still  retains much of the charm and atmosphere which made its lifestyle so envied and  desired by outsiders some three or four generations ago. Thus whilst it is true  that little is left but memories and faded photographs of so many of its major  buildings, it is equally true that with a little encouragement and sensitivity  much can still be rescued.</p>
        <p>This survey was brought about as the result of concern voiced by  the Simon van der Stel Society who were the major movers behind the  establishment of a Uitenhage 200 committee. The work has also received a  measure of support from the Uitenhage   Municipality who have  funded it and permitted some of its facilities to be used during the course of  the field work.</p>
        <p>The  purpose of this project was four-fold:</p>
        <ol type="a">
          <li>To  establish a listing of historical and architecturally noteworthy buildings and  environments present in the town of Uitenhage.  Such a catalogue would assist the further study of these buildings on the part  of architectural historians and conservation-conscious civic organisations.</li>
          <li>To  assist the Town Fathers and decision-makers of Uitenhage arrive at a realistic  assessment of the cultural worth of their own built environment. This would  enable them to establish and implement, should they so desire, an architectural  conservation policy for their town as a whole.</li>
          <li>To  assist the efforts of publicists of Uitenhage and its surrounds by providing  them with material for promotional purposes, and lastly, </li>
          <li>To  create an awareness of their own architectural heritage among the greater body  of citizens in this town, thus increasing their pride in their own physical  surrounds.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>It should be obvious that whilst the first objective of this survey  is fulfilled with the publication of this report, the last three are dependent  upon the goodwill and civic pride of the citizens of Uitenhage as a whole. The  authors of this project hope earnestly that the cudgels they have now fashioned  will be taken up by conservation-minded citizens of the town on their own  behalf. In this endeavour we wish them well.</p>
        <h5>THE  SURVEY</h5>
        <p>This study was conducted over a period of some ten weeks between  March and May 1986. It concentrated upon an area of Uitenhage bounded by Mitchell Street in  the south, High and Cannon Streets to the north, Van der Riet Street and Baines Road in the  east and Stow Road,  Magennis and Graaff-Reinet Streets to the west (Map 1). Isolated buildings of  architectural and historical merit outside this area were also identified and  recorded but no systematic search beyond the main research zone took place.  Thus, because this survey has concerned itself primarily with the town's  historical core, its data base should not be considered to be definitive. It is  probable that a research programme encompassing the greater Uitenhage area will  reveal the existence of further historical examples.</p>
        <p>A brief windscreen survey was also conducted in the black suburb  of Uitenhage immediately to the north-west of the research area. This revealed  a number of early domestic and community structures which, although in poor  condition, may warrant closer scrutiny at a subsequent date.</p>
        <p>A measure of research was also conducted, during the course of  this project, into the nature and quality of street-scape architecture in the  town. This applied most particularly to the quality of life perceived to be  present in some of the minor suburban streets as well as the architecture of  some of the town's more important entrances and exits.</p>
        <p>In the main, buildings surveyed ranged in their dating between the  early years of the nineteenth century through to the late Victorian and early  Edwardian era. Some structures of a more recent vintage, such as the Islamic  Mosque on Caledon street,  were also briefly documented where they were deemed to be of social,  environmental or aesthetic merit.</p>
        <p>The study area covered 83 town blocks involving a total of 1983  stands. For the purposes of this survey it was assumed that each stand was  occupied by only one building although, in at least three notable instances,  two buildings of historical worth were found to be located on the same stand.</p>
        <h5>SURVEY  METHODOLOGY</h5>
        <p>Following a measure of preparatory archival research, the project  was structured into three distinct stages:</p>
        <p>STAGE ONE consisted of a pavement survey during which 385  buildings were examined and photographed individually, all but five being  located in the historical core of the town. Buildings were analysed according  to the following criteria:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>location  and function - both current and historical.</li>
          <li>a  general description of their built form, architectural style and date of  construction.</li>
          <li>assessed  value of structure in its larger urban and environmental context.</li>
          <li>constructional  details, including structural condition and integrity.</li>
          <li>estimated  potential for structural restoration and/or functional revalidation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As a  result of the above data, buildings thus surveyed were graded into the  following categories:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>AA National Importance<br />
            A Outstanding example<br />
            B Good example, sound condition<br />
            C Good example, bad condition<br />
            D Old, low historical value<br />
            E Community value<br />
            F Intrusive or irrelevant</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>An additional X-factor was also included to denote a  building which in itself may not have been of great historical or aesthetic merit  but which, for reason of being part of a larger conglomeration of structures,  gained in value through its contextural setting or associations. In this  respect it is important to note that a number of streets lacking in major  historical or architectural landmarks but nonetheless presenting a charming and  well-preserved fa&ccedil;ade were also investigated as a whole. The buildings involved  however were not included in total number of structures surveyed. A listing of  such environments is included with this report as Appendix A.</p>
        <p>The placing of buildings into such a hierarchy however should not  be viewed in hard and finite terms. For one thing categorisation is inevitably  the product of the value systems of its authors. For another the creation of  inflexible divisions can at times give rise to incorrect assessments. Thus a  structure in a poor state of repair but having a high historical and landmark  value would not be classified as a C or D building but would be  raised to B or even A status. Similarly a building of high  historical value which has undergone extensive and insensitive  &quot;upgrading&quot; may be considered to be beyond restoration and thus be  relegated to F status.</p>
        <p>The full documentation resulting from this section of the&nbsp; work is being appended to this report as a  separate volume.</p>
        <p>STAGE TWO consisted of an intensive programme of site  documentation and photography which covered some 78 of these buildings, all but  one, Cuyler Manor, being located in the historical core of the town. These were  surveyed and measured up by the third year student group of the Department of  Architecture, University   of Port Elizabeth, under  the direct guidance of the authors. The choice of buildings thus chosen was  made according to the following criteria:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All  AA and most A grade buildings. Perhaps the one most notable  omission from this group has been that of the Town Hall which, however, was  felt to be already sufficiently well documented as not to warrant our most  immediate attention.</li>
          <li>Most  B grade buildings with preference being given to structures in a poor  state of repair or those considered to be most vulnerable to the threat of  demolition and redevelopment.</li>
          <li>A  number of C and D grade buildings were also chosen on the basis  of gaining a better understanding of the range of dwelling forms and  environmental textures available in Uitenhage.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The documentation produced as the outcome of Stage Two is being  included in this report. A full listing of all buildings assessed to be of A  or B grading is also given in Appendix B.</p>
        <p>Stage Two involved the formulation of progress reports dealing  with conservation. During this stage a number of archival sources in Uitenhage,  Grahamstown, Port Elizabeth,  Cape Town and Johannesburg were also  consulted. However, it was found that the data gathered in the process only  tended to confirm most of our early field results. It is thus possible to  conclude that bibliographical research has played a relatively minor role in  determining the course of this project. Included in this category is a small  survey report entitled UITENHAGE 2000 produced in 1985 by the Uitenhage  Town Engineer's Department whose conclusions were found to be of only marginal  interest to this study.</p>
        <p>STAGE THREE has involved the formulation of conservation  strategies, developmental arguments and zoning proposals.</p>
        <p>Stage One of this project was completed by April 1986 and  documented as many buildings as it was deemed feasible to cover given the scope  and the duration of this study. For the purposes of this work it was not found  necessary to build up a definitive listing of every structure within the  research area. This report therefore must not be viewed as a total accountancy  of the housing stock of central Uitenhage but rather as the record of a number  of structures and street-scapes considered to be of importance to the  historical fabric of the town.</p>
        <p>Stage Two was completed in May 1986 and culminated with the  presentation of this project's first interim report to the civic bodies  concerned. However it is the authors' hope that the Uitenhage 200 Committee or  the local municipality may consider extending this work on their own behalf  using this survey as a basic framework for future development.</p>
        <p>Stage Three may be considered to have been brought to a final  conclusion with the presentation of this report.</p>
        <p>The authors of this survey also envisage that a fourth stage will  take place at some future date when this material will find wider circulation  in book form, subject to an appropriate grant becoming available to subsidise  the costs of production. It is expected that this project will also give rise  to a number of additional publications, lectures and conference papers on the  subject of the Uitenhage case study.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>&quot;<em>The colonial villages or towns - as some of them may now be  properly termed - have usually grown up round the Dutch Church as a  nucleus;&nbsp; and it has been remarked that  these church or town sites had been chosen with great skill by the Dutch  colonists.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have come into contact  with those who had seen the growth of considerable villages from the solitary  farm-house of the first owner.&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon  as the church is built, there is no doubt as to a certain amount of business  being done where it stands.</em>&quot; MACKENZIE, John.

        </blockquote>
        <p>One of the earliest effects of white settlement in southern Africa during its first hundred years of existence was  the creation of an economic infrastructure within the immediate surrounds of Cape Town. This was to  provide subsequent developments in the colony with a solid platform for future  growth and the next fifty years were to witness the rapid expansion of  population along the southern Cape coast and  well into the Karoo region. Although the  magistracy and town of Graaff-Reinet were established in 1786 in order to meet  the needs of central government in this area, within one generation white  settlement had extended so far beyond this point, that the necessity for the  creation of another administrative centre in the region became evident. The  site chosen for the new town was on a farm owned by the widow of Gert Scheepers  and one of the first accounts we have of the event was given by Lichtenstein  who, writing in 1804, reported that:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>&quot;<em>A mile from hence, at the place of the Widow Schepers,  ground has been laid out for a Drosty, and a village adjoining to it, which is  to be the centre point of a new district:&nbsp;  it is to be called after the family name of the Commissary-general,  Uitenhage.</em>&quot;</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The proclamation of the district of Uitenhage was made on 25 April 1804 by the  Governor of the Cape, JW Janssens. He  entrusted Captain Ludwig Alberti, Commanding Officer of Fort Frederick at Algoa Bay,  with the task of finding a suitable location for the new magisterial seat as well  as with the laying out of the village. The choice of site appears to have been  guided by considerations of defence, it being relatively close to Algoa Bay,  by its natural beauty, and by the availability of a constant supply of water  from the Zwartkops   River.</p>
        <p>The village was laid out in the form of a perfect square, with the  Drostdy at its exact centre. However initial development of the settlement  appears to have been limited to its south-western quadrant probably, as is  claimed by Lewcock, to enable the Landdrost to supplement his income by farming  the land closest to his house in the south-eastern quadrant. Whatever the  reasons, this established the pattern for Uitenhage's development for the next  hundred years. It was not until the early decades of the twentieth century that  the town began expanding, to any major degree, into the surrounding  countryside, by which time the intent of Alberti's original master plan had  long been superseded.</p>
        <p>Two roads were to play an important role in the growth and development  of Uitenhage from an early stage in its history: Caledon street, running from east to  west, and Cuyler street,  running from north to south. These, together with the Graaff-Reinet road to the  north represent the major entry points into the town and this fact is  recognised in a number of ways by its architecture (Map 2).</p>
        <p>Cuyler street became the focus of the town's first  residential area virtually at its onset and many of the oldest surviving  residences of historic importance are located on either side of it. Caledon street on  the other hand became the collection point, at an equally early stage, for the  town's civic, administrative and religious functions. Despite the more recent  development of a business district in the area immediately south of it, it  retains to this day many of its more important buildings. The entry into the  town from Graaff-Reinet to the north is marked by the Victoria Tower  which, together with the NG Kerk steeple, remains the pivotal point of visual  reference for the community and its activities.</p>
        <p>Urban growth to the south of the town appears to have been curbed  by the presence of the Zwartkops river and this area has effectively only begun  to develop since the 1960's.</p>
        <p>Uitenhage's marketing functions have, from the onset, centred upon  a space south of Caledon street  between the Drostdy and present-day Market street (whence it derives its name).  With subsequent urban growth this area became formalised as the town's civic  heart making it the obvious location for its main library and the present Town  Hall, when the latter was built there in 1882. The growth of a CBD about this  square ought to be seen as the formal recognition of its former marketing use  and its present function as a parking area has deprived the town of a valuable civic  space.</p>
        <p>The arrival in Uitenhage in 1875 of the rail link with Port Elizabeth was to  have profound effects upon the urban fabric of the town. Not only did the  location of the station at the southern end of the market square reinforce the  civic role of this space, but the subsequent location and development of the Midland system's railway workshops in the area  immediately south of the Drostdy began to dictate the location of the town's  future light industrial sector. It also created about it an area of lower  income housing which survives as a distinct urban component to this very day.</p>
        <p>The history of the Malay and black communities in Uitenhage is one  that still needs to be comprehensively told. Whatever the reasons for their  original siting, the Malay and Islamic community have tended to congregate in  an area west of Cuyler street  and south of Caledon street  whilst a black suburb appears to have existed in the north-western quadrant of  the town since at least, if not before, the 1840's.</p>
        <p>The historical housing component of Uitenhage is perhaps its most  notable surviving urban feature. As previously stated, the town's earliest  residential area was centred in its south-eastern quadrant. This was in the  nature of semi- rural smallholding development and despite the fact that, by  the 1860's, the residential function had spread down to the Zwartkops river and  had begun overflowing northwards to Cannon    street, the town retained much of its rural rustic  charm. Backhouse, who visited Uitenhage in December 1838 was led to comment  that:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>&quot;<em>Uitenhage ...  is a pretty, English-looking town, containing about 315 houses, consisting of a  few streets crossing at right angles: it is well watered from a very copious  spring, situated on the karroo hills above the town.</em>&quot;</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>whilst Thomas Baines, who fifteen years later made several  sketches of the town from the surrounding hills, reported that:</p>
        <p>&quot;The town is situated near the left  bank of the Zwartkops river, about twelve miles from the sea; but is supplied  with water by a small spring which, issuing from the hills, pours through the  channels on either side the streets more than two million and a half gallons  daily. Rows of beautiful trees overhang the water, and the extensive orchards,  teeming with every tropical and European delicacy, almost hide the houses from  the view. A small battery, in an unfinished condition, overlooks the town and  racecourse&quot;</p>
        <p>Casalis,  writing in 1889, was led to reminisce that:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>&quot;<em>We did not go  far that day. The pretty little town of Uitenhage  came in sight after three hours of travel. The houses, surrounded by gardens,  were all in perfect repair. The population appeared to enjoy great prosperity,  the result of a judicious blending of commerce and agriculture.</em>&quot;</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Although it is true that the urban fabric which charmed visitors  to Uitenhage during the last century bears little relationship to the town of  today, it should be borne in mind that right up to the 1950's, resident and  visitors alike would comment about the grace and quality of lifestyle available  to its inhabitants. It is almost certain that much of this had to do with the  quality of Uitenhage's built environment, most particularly its public  buildings and its housing. The residential tradition did not change greatly  with the passing of the Victorian era but when the town spread north and east  of the Drostdy and north of Cannon    street during the 1920's, the same architectural  motifs, the cottage forms, verandahs, sash windows, barge boards and finials,  were all carried through to the newer suburbs. A great part of Uitenhage's  present charm is that many of these features have survived to the present day.  Some, carefully nurtured by their owners, will probably last well into the next  century. Others, falling into decay, are being lost daily.</p>
        <p>The historical core of the town may thus be perceived to lie in an  area roughly bounded by Van Der Riet, Market and Cannon streets and the  Zwartkops river. Peripheral developments of historical importance occur  immediately north of Cannon street  and in the area surrounding the Drostdy. Civic and commercial functions focus  upon present-day Market and Caledon  streets on either side of the Victoria  tower.</p>
        <p>Since 1910 most of the town's growth patterns have tended to  follow its major arterial links with Graaff-Reinet to the north and Port Elizabeth to the  south. More recently the establishment of a dormitory town at Despatch has had  the effect of incorporating Uitenhage into the larger metropolital reach of Port Elizabeth thus  making its economic survival a matter of regional importance.</p>

        <h5>DISTRIBUTION  OF SAMPLE</h5>
        <p>A locational plan of the sites as well as the streets concerned (  Maps 3 to 8) presents an interesting picture. It reveals that the historical  zone of Uitenhage survives in the form of four major cores (Map 9):</p>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>the  Drostdy area</li>
          <li>the  greater Market street  area</li>
          <li>the  Victoria Tower/Park Lane  area</li>
          <li>he  Cuyler street/Durban street area</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The first focuses upon the area immediately east of the  Drostdy-Railway workshops axis and, apart from these two major buildings, is of  a predominantly residential nature. Stands are less than 500 square metres in  size and dwellings are, in the main, small cottages indicating a relatively humble  working class origin. This area was developed as the result of growth in the  town's light industrial sector during the post-1880 era and, over the years has  become entrenched as a lower and middle income suburb. Many dwellings have  managed to retain some of the decorative architectural trimmings of an earlier  and more gracious age. This has allowed the suburb to retain a homogeneity of  architecture which has given many of its streets charming vistas. It is likely  that, as redevelopment of the railway yards takes place to its south and  commercial strip development extends along Caledon street, this area will come under  increasing threat from redevelopers and land speculators who will unavoidably  seek to destroy its character. This may result in the loss of such worthwhile  architecture as 49 Caledon street  and the stepped row houses, 8-18, of Rhodes    street.</p>
        <p>The second encompasses the major part of Market street. Included in this area are  the Town Hall, Market Square,  the Electricity Department, the (restored) Railway Station, St Catherines  Church and some domestic developments south of Durban street. Most commercial buildings  located at the north end of this area have undergone extensive and often  intrusive alteration. However with careful restoration and, in some cases,  reconstruction, they could recreate a charming shopping mall rich in economic  potential. The institutional buildings in this area may be considered to be  relatively safe from redevelopment, although the Town Hall itself has already  been subjected to major extension some years ago. However some thought may be  given to the creation of a pedestrian mall in upper Market street and the restoration of Market Square to  some of its more civic functions. For the purposes of this study all  residential structures in lower Market    street were considered to be under danger of  redevelopment to either residential or covert light industrial activity.</p>
        <p>The third concerns the zone surrounding the Victoria Tower  and includes many structures of an institutional nature. Because of their  importance these were considered to be under little immediate threat of  demolition with the exception of the Victoria   Tower whose present  functions were considered to be inimical to its standing in this country's  architectural heritage. Other buildings also located in this area were the NG  Kerk and manse, the Masonic Temple, the Synagogue, 4 Baird street and a number  of other smaller but charming buildings of a residential nature. Major threats  to their conservation were considered to be forthcoming from the continued  spread of the CBD and, equally important, the more recent development of high  rise residential structures which are already beginning to overshadow the  profile of older and more stately civic buildings.</p>
        <p>The last node covers the greater Cuyler street area, including parts of Durban street west  and Caledon street west.  This incorporates some of the town's oldest surviving residential structures  such as 166 Caledon street (also known as the &quot;Slave House&quot;), 11  Cuyler street, dating back to c1815, an 1817 Cape Dutch manor, a number of  important and predominantly domestic buildings and a grouping of religious and  domestic buildings which play a prominent role in the heritage of the local  Islamic community. This node must be considered to be the most important of the  four, being both the oldest and the most threatened. Danger to this built  environment is currently being presented by an encroachment of light industrial  functions, commercial reconstruction, lack of maintenance and a failure by  local planners to prevent intrusive developments which threaten to destroy the  historical fabric of the area.</p>
        <p>Other zones which fall outside these major cores include the  residential area immediately north of Cannon street west, which does not appear  to be under current threat; and Lower Drostdy street which is highly vulnerable  to encroaching industrial development and a lack of maintenance. The black  suburb immediately west of the town centre was also considered to be  threatened, but by a combination of factors more complex than those of simple  environmental control.</p>
        <p>Out of a total of 380 buildings surveyed in the town's historical  centre, 294 of them, or 77% of the total are located in the four historical  cores outlined above. Their distribution may be broken down as follows:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>the Drostdy area: 151 or 39.7% of the  total<br />
            the Market street area: 29 or 7.6% of the  total<br />
            the Victoria Tower  area: 52 or 13.7% of the total<br />
            the Cuyler street area: 62 or 16.3% of the  total<br />
            historical area not covered by above: 86  or 22.7% of the total</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>It will be seen therefore that, with the exception of the Drostdy  area, only 143 structures of architectural importance remain in the town's  historical centre. This represents 38% of the survey and, more importantly, only  7.2% of all buildings to be found in this area. Assuming that Uitenhage is to  continue losing these buildings at its present rate of one every month, the  town shall have lost most if not all of its major historical structures of a  non-institutional nature by the year 1998.</p>
        <h5>ZONING  AND LAND USE</h5>
        <p>Under the town's present land use bye-laws, the major portion of  the study area can be seen to fall under a single Residential Zoning.  Exceptions to this general rule may be found in most stands located alongside Caledon, Durban, Market, Baird and Constitution  streets, all of which permit a Business function. The area south of Mitchell street to  the Zwartkops river is zoned under Industrial as is the western side of Cuyler street south  of Durban street  (see Map 10). A regrettable development in recent times appears to have been  the spread of light industrial and commercial functions to Cuyler street north of Durban street and the whole of Durban street. This  seems to be partly the result of consent usage or, most likely, the result of  covert and hence illegal operations by small entrepreneurs.</p>
        <h5>RATES</h5>
        <p>Figures  given relate to the 1985-1986 financial year.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Total rates collected from whole town:  R3,457,965.00<br />
            Total rates collected from study area:  R130,000.00 (est.)<br />
            Total income of town (all sources):  R42,466,455.00</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The estimate of rates collected from the study area was based on  the available data for 361 of the stands surveyed and its total was  R101,000.00. The remaining 19 could yield no information and their combined  rates were estimated conservatively at R29,000.00 giving the total of R130,000  given above. It should also be borne in mind that a number of structures on  this listing, such as the Town Hall, are of a non-ratable nature.</p>
        <p>Taking the above data into consideration, it will be seen that the  income derived by the Uitenhage Municipality from the rates of the 380 stands  surveyed amount to no more than 3.8% of the total income collected from all  rates and, more importantly, only 0.3% of the town's total income derived from  all sources.</p>
        <h5>CONDITION  OF BUILDINGS</h5>
        <p>During the course of this study it was found that the condition of  structures surveyed varied greatly and no overall trends could be detected in  this regard. However it was also concluded that certain classes of buildings  serving one set of functions were generally in a better state of maintenance  than others. Thus it is believed that most buildings in institutional use are  currently in little if any danger of demolition. Because their budgets are  funded from civic sources, their state of maintenance and structural integrity  was found to be generally high and warranted little concern in this regard.  Notable exceptions to this rule were the Victoria Tower,  where the threat is potential rather than actual; and the Drostdy whose  structure has, over the years, undergone a number of harsh alterations.</p>
        <p>A source of real concern to this study was the lack of maintenance  and the proliferation of insensitive alterations found to exist in the case of  residential architecture across the full range of eras and styles. Much of what  is endearing about the built environment of Uitenhage is also ephemeral and the  town is losing its verandahs, fretted timber fascias, cast iron work and timber  trims on an almost daily basis through public apathy, lack of design, and  neglect. These are irreplaceable and need not be lost. We believe that, with  proper encouragement, there exists an opportunity for Uitenhage to retain and,  in some cases, recreate the moods and architectural styles of a more gracious  age which may now have passed but which many people today refer to with a  degree of nostalgia.</p>
        <p>This study regretfully has to report that it has been unable to  discover much architecture of historical note in the fields of commercial and industrial  building. Isolated instances of cast iron trimmings, verandah supports and  timber shopfronts have been evident from time to time but not in sufficient  numbers to warrant more than a passing paragraph in this report. One major  exception to this rule is the Railway workshop complex south of the Drostdy  area which presents a series of well articulated brick-walled sheds, mostly in  good structural order. It is believed that with imaginative design, these could  be revalidated to new and exciting community functions. However the authors of  this report could not find consensus regarding the value of the relatively  modern steel buildings standing alongside their more historical counterparts.</p>
        <h5>INFORMAL  CONSERVATION STRATEGIES IN PROGRESS</h5>
        <p>It is possible to report that despite the larger drawbacks which  environmental conservation is experiencing in Uitenhage at present, a small  number of cases where these trends have been reversed have been recorded during  the course of this study. The most notable of these concerns the work of the  Uitenhage Town Engineer's Department who, through a mixture of hard common  sense and imagination, has brought the Cuyler Manor and Railway Station  restoration projects to a successful conclusion. Despite the fact that one is  located some 5 km out of town and the other is on a relatively small scale,  their contribution to the quality of the town's environment has already made  itself felt. Other projects of a domestic scale are currently in progress or  were recently completed.&nbsp;&nbsp; All appear to  be the work of enthusiastic amateurs or far-sighted businessmen who have  realised the obvious financial sense of siting their premises in attractive  buildings of a historical nature which, when properly restored, stand out from  the crass aluminium and glass architecture of more recent times.</p>
        <p>It is regrettable that in virtually every case the process of  restoration has also involved the removal of the front verandah. It should be  pointed out that while it is true that in many cases such structures were the  result of a later addition or a modification to an early settler cottage, their  use was highly functional and particularly well suited to local climatic  conditions. The restoration of a historical building need not necessarily  attempt to return the structure to some kind of pristine purity. It should  rather assess how and when certain changes were wrought to it and decide  exactly how far back in time the restoration process need be taken. In many  cases the removal of a verandah may also result in the exposure of the base of  the house wall to the elements. Should the dwelling be of such a vintage that  either the walls were built in an earth technology or be lacking in suitable  damp-proofing, then long-term damage to the structure may result.</p>
        <h5>CONSERVATION  STRATEGIES</h5>
        <p>It is not the duty of this report to preach to its readers on the  moral merits of a conservation policy for the town as a whole. Suffice it to  say that at a time of economic depression many people may feel that it is the  duty of the City Fathers to encourage a diversity of activities which will  promote the economic welfare of the community as a whole.</p>
        <p>Because in many ways, conservation in Uitenhage is in the hands of  gifted dilettanti and public-spirited businessmen it behoves this report to set  out some basic guidelines for a conservation policy.</p>
        <ol type="a">
          <li>A  conservation policy does not set out to create a large number of museums nor a  whole museum town. It rather seeks to maintain and restore the character of a  built environment and retain a worthwhile quality of life for its inhabitants.</li>
          <li>It  does not concern itself only with individual buildings but seeks to look at the  environment as a whole. There does not appear to be much sense in restoring a  national monument only to site a factory next door to it later on.</li>
          <li>It  seeks to revalidate old buildings, giving them new relevance in line with  current economic needs and realities.</li>
          <li>It  does not necessarily mean restoring the building back to either its original  function nor its original forms.</li>
          <li>It  does not mean creating something that was never there and passing it off as the  original and genuine article.</li>
          <li>A  conservation policy does set out to create economic development in a variety of  ways</li>
          <ul>
            <ul>
              <li>such  as making work opportunities in times of economic depression.</li>
              <li>such  as the recyclying of old buildings at a fraction of the cost of new ones.</li>
              <li>such  as encouraging peripheral economic activities as tourism and small businesses  based upon conservation work.</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <li>conservation  policy does set out to preserve and present the culture and values of a place,  region or people, thereby allowing them to derive pride in their own  achievements.</li>
        </ol>
        <h5>RECOMMENDATIONS</h5>
        <p>It is the recommendation of this report that the Town Council of  Uitenhage establish as a matter of urgency a conservation policy for the town  as a whole. This should take into account short as well as long term  strategies.</p>
        <h5>A. SHORT  TERM STRATEGIES</h5>
        <ul>
          <ol start="1" type="1">
            <li type="1" value="1">The  Proclamation of a &quot;Historical Area&quot;. It is the belief of the authors  that whilst an individual may have the right to enjoy the full usufruct of his  property within the bounds of the law, this usufruct should not infringe upon  the right of his neighbours or the community as a whole to enjoy the lifestyle  they wish to pursue. At present the community already has the powers to curb  the over- enthusiastic usufruct of land by individuals and delegates these to  an elected civic authority to enforce them - usually in the form of building  bye-laws and land-use restrictions. However such curbs usually only act as a  limit to physical activities and building standards; little is normally laid  down regarding the visual impact of buildings.<br />
              <br />
            When however we deal with the subject of  conserving historical architecture, the visual component becomes of paramount  importance. This report has already laid particular emphasis upon the concept  of contextural setting. It is our recommendation therefore that provision be  made in the town bye-laws for the protection of community rights in the special  field of the historical built environment.<br />
            <br />
            This may be implemented through the  proclamation, by the Uitenhage Council, of a &quot;Historical Area&quot; within  the town. The extent of such an area is open to further discussion but it is  our suggestion that its minimum limits cover those established by the extent of  this survey, with the exception of certain residential blocks south of Durban street and  east of Cuyler street.<br />
            The purpose of establishing such an area  would be to create a zone within which all new developments submitted for  municipal approval would have to meet certain stringent criteria.
            <ol type="a">
              <li>No  demolition of existing structures to take place prior to Municipal approval  being obtained.</li>
              <li>Submission  of plans to take place only after the project has been approved in principle at  sketch plan stage by the Municipality.</li>
              <li>All  new projects to submit contextural drawings indicating the impact of new  buildings upon the existing environment.</li>
              <li>A  height limit of three storeys to be observed. This limitation may have to be  accompanied by a relaxation in current site coverage and bulk factors so as to  not place undue curbs on commercial development in the CBD area. Ultimately it  is envisaged that the Council will have to develop a separate strategy towards  the CBD area itself.</li>
            </ol>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <ol start="2" type="1">
            <li type="1" value="2">The  Proclamation of &quot;Conservation Areas&quot;. It is the recommendation of  this report that, as an extension of the concept of a &quot;Historical  Area&quot;, certain other zones of special importance be recognised and  subjected to further stringent controls. Included under such a proclamation  would be the following areas or sites:</li>
          </ol>
        </ul>
        <p>All buildings facing onto the following streets:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p> Caledon street, from Dobson street east up to the railway  bridge.<br />
            Caledon street, between the Victoria Tower  and the Congregational Church.<br />
            Cuyler street, north of Mitchell street.<br />
            Flanagan street, as a whole.<br />
            Gates street, as a whole.<br />
            Graaff-Reinet    street, between Cannon and Caledon  streets.<br />
            Langdon street, as a whole.<br />
            Luyt street, as a whole.<br />
            Mall street, as a whole.<br />
            Market street, between Caledon  and Mitchell streets.<br />
            Milner road, as a whole.<br />
            Park Avenue, between Cannon and High streets.<br />
            Park Lane, as a whole.<br />
            Upper Drostdy street,  as a whole.<br />
            All sites of &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot;  buildings listed in this report.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Additional controls envisaged for this area would include the  following:</p>
        <ol type="a">
          <li>A  demolition freeze upon all A, B and C grade buildings.  This involves a total of 147 structures located on 144 stands. As however  seventeen of these are of an institutional or civic nature, the total number of  stands affected is 127 or 6.4% of all stands in the Historical Area.<br />
            <br />
            Such freeze is to be enforced for an  initial period of two years until 31 December 1988 to allow the Council an opportunity to  formulate and enforce a comprehensive conservation policy for the town. It may  however be allowed to lapse at the Council's discretion should the necessary  infrastructure be established before that time.</li>
          <li>All  structural alterations to the buildings designated above shall be submitted to  the Municipality at an early sketch plan stage for their conditional approval.</li>
          <li>Permission  for all improvements of a non-structural nature upon the buildings designated  above to be granted at the discretion of the Municipality. This includes the  removal of fretted timber and cast iron trims, roof ventilators, plaster dados,  replacement of doors and windows and re-roofing, but specifically excludes  repainting and day-to-day maintenance of the structure.</li>
          <li>For  the purposes of this report any trees or plantings which can be shown to have  historical connotations may be included into the concept of a &quot;Conservation  Area&quot;.</li>
        </ol>
        <h5>B. LONG  TERM STRATEGIES</h5>
        <ol>
          <li>The  appointment of a Conservation Steering Committee. This concept replaces that of  an &quot;Aesthetics Committee&quot; proposed in our interim report of May 1986.  This committee should be multi-disciplinary in composition and include  representatives of the Town Council, the Chambers of Commerce and Industry,  conservation-minded civic bodies and a variety of professional consultants.  This body should be established as part of the immediate implementation of a  short-term strategy but its work must be viewed in the context of a long-term  conservation policy. It is envisaged that this Committee shall have the  following brief:</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
          <ul>
            <ol type="a">
              <li>The  formulation of a long-term conservation policy for the town of Uitenhage as a whole.</li>
              <li>To  review the extent and nature of the Historical and Conservational Areas as set  out in this report.</li>
              <li>The  formulation of a new set of zoning, building and land-use bye-laws for the  Historical Area as a whole. Special consideration will have to be given, in  this respect, to the applicability of the new Standard National Building  Bye-Laws.</li>
              <li>The  creation of a municipal infrastructure which will be responsible for the  implementation of the new conservation policy. The Steering Committee may  decide at its own discretion that it is the correct body for such  implementation or may choose to establish a separate body for this purpose.</li>
              <li>To  create the machinery which will encourage the participation of rate payers in  the conservation process of their built environment.</li>
              <li>To  review and extend the listing of the Conservation Register referred to in (4)  below.</li>
              <li>To  administer the Conservation Trust Fund referred to in (3) below.</li>
            </ol>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <ol start="2">
          <li type="1" value="2">The  appointment of a Town Architect for Uitenhage. One of the drawbacks encountered  by conservationists in Uitenhage is the lack of local architectural expertise.  It is our recommendation that the post of Town Architect be established under  the aegis of the Town Engineer's Department. Such an appointment will  facilitate the workings of the Conservation Steering Committee. His job  description should include the following:
            <ol type="a">
              <li>To  consider all proposals for the development of new buildings, the redevelopment  of conservation-sensitive sites and the revalidation of existing buildings in  the Historical Area. His findings in this regard shall be put before the  committee responsible for the approval of such applications in order to guide  and inform their final decision- making process.</li>
              <li>To  consider and approve all applications of a minor nature affecting any  alterations and additions being proposed to listed buildings.</li>
              <li>To  create and upkeep a &quot;Register of Historical and Threatened Buildings&quot;  referred to in (4) below.</li>
              <li>To  be involved in the motivation of new national monuments in the town.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>To  establish a &quot;Conservation Trust Fund&quot;. It is expected that finances  for the day-to-day administration of a conservation policy will be necessary.  This report recommends that a Conservation Trust Fund be established in this  regard by the Town Council. It is further recommended that the rates currently  being paid annually by owners of the 385 listed buildings, amounting to an  estimated R130,000 per annum, be voted over by the Council to this Fund. It is  envisaged that such money will be used as follows:</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
          <ul>
            <ul>
              <ul>
                <ol type="a">
                  <li>To  establish the Register of Historical and Threatened Buildings  as referred to in (4) below.</li>
                  <li>To  pay for the services of expert consultants.</li>
                  <li>To  fund research into the conservation of Uitenhage's built environment, such as,  for example, this study.</li>
                  <li>To  subsidise publications on the subject.</li>
                  <li>To  subsidise the Steering Committee's day to day operating costs.<br />
                    <br />
                    It is envisaged however that, as the scope  for conservation grows so then this Fund will be called upon to play an  increasing role in the implementation of conservation policies. It is foreseen,  for example, that the Fund may eventually provide financing for the restoration  of important buildings in Uitenhage</li>
                </ol>
              </ul>
            </ul>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <ol start="4" type="1">
          <li type="1" value="4">The  creation of a &quot;Register of Historical and Threatened Buildings&quot;  for the town of Uitenhage.  It is hoped that such a register will use this study as a basis for future  expansion.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol start="5" type="1">
          <li type="1" value="5">Some  General Recommendations. Although this study was not commissioned to submit  detailed proposals regarding the conservation of Uitenhage's built environment,  we should like to conclude this report with a number of recommendations.</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
          <ol type="a">
            <li>This  study believes that the granting of business rights to the site south of and  adjoining stands 15737 facing onto Cuyler    street was a major error which, if allowed to  reach maturity, will result in the loss of one of the town's few remaining  potential national monuments and may damage irreparably the character of Cuyler street. We  believe that two courses are open to the Council in this regard: to expropriate  the site and compensate the owner before development takes place;&nbsp; or alternatively to demand a high design and  landscape component in any future development which may be submitted to the  Council for their approval.</li>
            <li>The  question of intrusive buildings and activities will also have to be addressed  as in the case of Centenary Square where a valuable civic space has been given  over to motor vehicles and tarmac.</li>
            <li>It  is imperative that a feasibility study be conducted on the potential for  revalidation of historical buildings. This is particularly necessary in the  case of the Victoria   Tower and the Railway  workshops as well as the domestic structures in Cuyler street. In this regard special  attention should be given to their potential to accommodate professional  functions and speciality shops.</li>
            <li>In  some cases the Town Council may consider initiating a programme of urban  renewal by restoring buildings under their control, by resurfacing selected  streets with cobbles, by the use of environmentally sensitive signposting, by  the replacement of intrusive light standards, by the screening of intrusive buildings  with plantings and by removing unsightly overhead wiring.</li>
            <li>The  Town Council may also consider the closure of Market street between Durban and Caledon streets and its conversion to a  pedestrian mall.</li>
            <li>Any  future town planning design will also have to address the question of providing  the town with suitably demarcated entry points. At present the streetscape of Caledon street near  the Drostdy provides such a function.</li>
          </ol>
