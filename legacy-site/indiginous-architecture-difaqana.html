        <h5 align="left">THE ARCHITECTURE OF SOUTHERN   AFRICA 
          BEFORE THE DIFAQANE</h5>
        <p align="left">Franco Frescura</p>
        <h5>ABSTRACT</h5>
        <p>The Sotho word Difaqane, or to give it its Nguni equivalent  mfecane, means, literally, &quot;the scattering of the people&quot;. It  represents a period in the history of southern Africa,  between 1822 and 1837, which saw massive population shifts, the depopulation of  large tracts of land, widespread hardship and famine and the emergence of  centralised forms of government over many parts of the sub-continent. It also  coincided with the large scale encroachment of migrant Dutch farmers into the  southern African interior, an increase in European missionary efforts, an  acceleration of British military involvement in the affairs of the region and a  rise in the entrepreneurial activities of white traders and merchants. The  Difaqane therefore was a time of transition which was to transform the whole  nature of rural tribal society and pave the way for changes in the region's  economy and system of government.</p>
        <p>As might be expected, the Difaqane also marks a point of no return  in the indigenous architecture of southern Africa.  Its momentous upheavals not only altered local settlement patterns but, in many  ways, also facilitated future events. Thereafter contact between white  immigrant and black indigenous groups took place with increased frequency  thereby creating opportunities for the cross-cultural transmission of building  forms and technologies. The introduction of trader artifacts, sun-dried bricks,  triangulated roof systems, new roofing materials and the educational efforts of  missionaries all combined to bring about slow but irreversible changes in the  local built environment.</p>
        <p>This paper seeks to analyse the nature of southern African  architecture before and during the Difaqane. It synthesizes data from a variety  of early historical and archaeological sources and examines the validity of  currently-held stereotypes of past built environments. It also looks at  examples of early cross-cultural architectural borrowings and attempts to  establish patterns of future change.</p>
        <h5>INTRODUCTION</h5>
        <p>The organisers of this conference have chosen to focus its theme  upon the twin concepts of &quot;Enlightenment&quot;  and &quot;Emancipation&quot;, most  particularly as they manifested themselves during the ninety-odd years between  1744 and 1834. This is, of course, quite ironic, for, in southern Africa at  least, it represents a period when the indigenous inhabitants of the region  began to be subjected at the hands of white immigrants, to a process of  colonialisation, of dispossession, of enslavement and, in some cases, even of  genocide.&nbsp; It was a time when they began  to lose control over their lands, their labour, their culture and their lives.  At first the only people affected by the European settlement of the Cape were  the Khoikhoi pastoralists who bartered their cattle for Dutch trinkets, but as  white farmers, traders and explorers began to expand ever inland, these came  into contact with San hunter gatherers, with the Nguni farmers of the coastal  belt and ultimately with the Sotho/Tswana farmers of the interior. The  relationships which developed between white and black during this era  established a pattern which survives, in many ways, to the present day.</p>
        <p>During the eighteenth century, for example, the Khoikhoi were  progressively dispossessed of their lands, decimated by smallpox and deprived  of their labour by a series of laws designed to reduce them to a level slightly  better than slavery (1). By 1834 all that was left of this once numerous nation  was small pockets in Namaqualand and southern Namibia,  in the northern Cape and southern Free State, and in the eastern Cape. Miserable as their lot must  have been, even they fared better than their San compatriots who were subjected  during this time to a systematic campaign of enslavement and genocide. Barrow  told in 1797 of how:</p>
        <p>&quot;<em>A boor from Graaff Reynet being  asked ... if the savages were numerous or troublesome on the road, replied he  had only shot four, with as much composure and indifference as if he had been  speaking of four partridges. I myself have heard one of the humane colonists  boast of having destroyed with his own hands near three hundred of these  unfortunate wretches.</em>&quot;  (2)</p>
        <p>This slaughter did not cease with the imposition of a British  colonial administration at the Cape in 1806,  nor indeed for many years thereafter. Thompson reported in 1823 that:</p>
        <p>&quot;<em>While at this place, I heard that a  Commando (or expedition of armed boors) had been recently out against the  Bushmen in the mountains, where they had shot thirty of these poor creatures.&nbsp; I also learned that about 100 Bushmen had  been shot last year in the Tarka</em>&quot;. (3)</p>
        <p>Further east by 1834 the Cape  frontier had become the stage for a long series of protracted border conflicts  against the Xhosa. Four of them took place by this time and their resultant  effect was to drive these people from their winter grazing, which at one time  had extended as far south as Port    Elizabeth, to an area north of the Great Kei, a  distance of some 350km. The ensuing overpopulation of the southern Transkei and  the build up of pressures for more grazing land were to set the stage for the  so-called &quot;Great Cattle Slaughter&quot; of 1856 with all the resultant  hardship and famine that this brought to the region.</p>
        <p>Finally, only two years after this era of supposed &quot;enlightenment  and emancipation&quot; had ended, groups of indigent, land-hungry Dutch farmers  invaded the southern African interior, unleashing one land war after the other,  and taking with them a baggage train filled with prejudice, chauvinism, greed  and intolerance, the legacy of which lives on to plague our lives and our  relationships to this very day.</p>
        <p>It is against this &quot;enlightened&quot;  and &quot;emancipated&quot; social  backdrop that the architectural events which I am about to outline took place.</p>
        <h5>THE BROAD  PICTURE</h5>
        <p>It must be understood that before the 1820s such concepts as  &quot;Sotho&quot;, &quot;Tswana&quot;, &quot;Pedi&quot;, and  &quot;Ndebele&quot; did not have the firm connotations of regional and group  identity which have been awarded them in more recent times. The South Sotho,  for example, were a conglomeration of Sotho/Tswana and Nguni speaking groups  who fled to the Lesotho  highlands during the Difaqane of 1822-1836 and came to be united under one  leader, Moshweshwe. The Zulu, on the other hand, were a small clan living in  northern Natal  who, at the turn of the nineteenth century, numbered little more than 2000  persons. The idea of a larger Zulu kingdom was not initiated until after 1816  when Shaka took over their leadership. Thus it becomes difficult to discuss the  indigenous architecture of southern Africa  before this time through the use of current group nouns or regional identities.  The best we may do is to interpret the larger architectural patterns of that  time in terms of regional technologies, dwelling forms and the economic  activities of their builders. An overlay of all three such images gives us a  picture which is not only well focused but, amazingly enough, yields a large  amount of fine detail.</p>
        <h5>CONCLUSIONS</h5>
        <p>Many of the architectural traditions I have outlined here are no  longer with us. Some, like the stilt dwellings of Kaditshwene have not existed  for over a century; others, like the &quot;inverted sparrowpots&quot; of Lesotho, only  vanished a bare generation ago. Much of my own work in rural areas over the  past twelve years has, in many ways, been the task of a modern archaeologist,  piecing together the fragments of vanished traditions, and many of the patterns  I observed as recently in 1979 in places such as Venda, have now disappeared, never  to return.</p>
        <p>I must therefore ask that you not be fooled by the academic nicety  of your conference title. The whites who came here during the seventeenth and  eighteenth centuries may have been living in their own age of emancipation and  enlightenment, but they brought none of these qualities with them. Instead they  came as rapacious invaders who subjugated, plundered and destroyed. The same  morality which converted &quot;natives&quot; to christianity also enslaved them  and took away their land; the same people who rode out in 1823 on horseback to  shoot &quot;bushmen&quot;, ride out today on &quot;Buffels&quot;; and the same  barbarians who shot out the quagga from our plains now trade in ivory and rhino  horn. What little is left today is but a fraction of the rich natural and  cultural heritage we have lost and our current political stance will undoubtedly  ensure that the rest will be gone within the lifetime of my generation.</p>
        <h5>POSTSCRIPT</h5>
        <p>This paper was originally delivered to a conference on Enlightement and Emancipation? South African  Perspectives on the 18th and Early 19th Centuries, held in Durban on 13-16 September 1989, entitled The  Architecture of Southern Africa Before the Difaqane. To the best of my  knowledge it has never been published.</p>
