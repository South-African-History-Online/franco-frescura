		<p><strong>H</strong></p>
		<p>HAAKLAT. (Afrikaans). See under BINDER.</p>
		<p> HAISI. (Venda). Meaning a house. Term used  to describe a square plan, pitched roof dwelling.</p>
		<p> HALF-HIPPED ROOF. Also called a jerkin head roof; a roof  which is hipped from the ridge halfway to the eaves and gabled from there down.  (Afrikaans: wolfentgeweldak).</p>
		<p> HALF-TIMBER  CONSTRUCTION. A  structure formed of timber posts, rails and struts. The inter-spaces of this  frame are then filled with brick, rubble, clay or other materials and the whole  is often plastered over. (Afrikaans: hout-en-steenkonstruksie).</p>
		<p> HANDVATSEL. (Afrikaans). See under HANDLE.</p>
		<p> HANDLE. Lever or bracket, usually protruding  from surface of door, drawer or lid, used to gain a handhold or operate a  locking device. (Afrikaans: handvatsel).</p>
		<p> HANEBALK. (Afrikaans). Derived from the Dutch.  Timber tie beam in the roof truss of a Cape Dutch  house. Currently used in Afrikaans to describe a collar beam.</p>
		<p> HANGSTYL. (Afrikaans). See under QUEEN POST.</p>
		<p> HANGSTYLKAP. (Afrikaans). See under QUEEN POST TRUSS.</p>
		<p> HARDBIESHUIS. Plural Hardbieshuise. From the  Dutch, literally meaning a house made from hard reeds. A dwelling form built in  southern Africa up to the turn of the  twentieth century by both white settlers and indigenous residents. It consisted  of a series of modified A-frame trusses placed on the ground and thatched over  with reeds. See also KAPSTEILHUIS.</p>
		<p> HARMIKA. (Indian). The balcony railing of an  early Buddhist stupa in India,  which encloses the yasti, and signifies the palace of heaven atop the  world mountain. Its use is derived from the ancient Vedic practice of enclosing  a sacred tree with a fence.</p>
		<p>HEMISPHERICAL GRASS DWELLINGS. Domestic structures found predominantly in the   eastern littoral regions of southern Africa although examples have also been  recorded in the interior of the country. They were built out of a series of  sapling arches, bound into a large hemispherical framework which was then  covered over with either reed mats, grass mats, or grass thatching, or a  combination of these materials. Instances are also known where they were  coated, internally, externally or on both sides, with clay. A number of regional  styles of construction are known to have been used in the past although  currently some hemispherical dwellings  may only be found in parts of Zululand,  Swaziland and Lesotho. In more recent times there has been a tendency in rural  areas to replace hemispherical  structures with more substantial dwelling forms.</p>
		<p> HERDBOY'S HUTS. Temporary shelters erected by herd-boys  or farmhands during their sojourn away from their villages at times of  planting, harvest and cattle movement.</p>
		<p> HIGHVELD DWELLING. Rectangular plan structure, usually  single cell and roofed over with a lean-to roof falling from a raised parapet  facade to the rear of the building. Historically this building type originated  in Cape Town  during the latter half of the eighteenth century where it became associated  with Malay or slave dwellings. Its form and constructional technology made it a  highly efficient residential form in warm, dry climates such as that of the Karroo where it flourished during the early part of the  nineteenth century. It became associated with the Trekboer culture of  that era and was transplanted to the highveld by Dutch farmers emigrating there  after 1836. During that time it also became associated with the Griqua of the northern Cape. The  introduction of corrugated iron in the southern African interior assisted in  its spread and after the South African conflict of 1899-1902 it became  associated with Afrikaner rural culture. During the 1940s it began to be  adopted by black farmers on the highveld where it predominates to the present  day. In more recent times however, it has become associated with urban squatter  camps such as those found at Thaba 'Nchu in the OFS and Winterveld near Pretoria.</p>
		<p> HINGE. The joint on which doors and gates turn.  (Afrikaans: skarnier).</p>
		<p> HIP. The external angle formed by the meeting  of the sloping sides of a roof which have their wall-plates running in  different directions. (Afrikaans: wolfhoek).</p>
		<p> HIP-KNOB. A pinnacle, finial or other similar  ornament, placed on top of a roof hip or on a gable apex. (Afrikaans: ruiter).</p>
		<p> HIP RAFTER. A rafter spanning from roof ridge to  eaves thus creating the hip ridge. (Afrikaans: hoekbalk).</p>
		<p> Hlaka. (sePedi). Tie beam.</p>
		<p> HOEKBALK. (Afrikaans). See under HIP RAFTER.</p>
		<p> HOEKBOOG. (Afrikaans). See under SQUINCH.</p>
		<p> HOEKVLAKVORMIG. (Afrikaans). See under SPANDREL.</p>
		<p> HOMESTEAD. General term used to indicate rural  settlement of indeterminate size and composition. (Afrikaans: opstal).</p>
		<p> HOOD MOULD. Also called a label mould or a  dripstone; a projecting moulding on the face of a wall, usually above a door or  window. (Afrikaans: kaplys or druplys).</p>
		<p> HOOFSTYL. (Afrikaans). See under CROWN POST or  KING POST.</p>
		<p>		  HOOFSTYLKAP. (Afrikaans). See under KING POST TRUSS.</p>
		<p> HOOK. Iron hook used for fixing thatch to  timbers. (Afrikaans: dekgrashaak).</p>
		<p> HORTJIETORING. (Afrikaans). See under LOUVRE.</p>
		<p> HOUSE. Conventionally used to indicate  domicile, but may also find relevance in an anthropological context to describe  the social hierarchies and inheritance patterns of indigenous society.  (Afrikaans: huis or tuiste).</p>
		<p> HOUSEHOLD. Used in a general sense to describe the  social group comprising a rural domestic establishment. (Afrikaans: huishouding).</p>
		<p> HOUT-EN-STEENKONSTRUKSIE. See under HALF-TIMBER CONSTRUCTION.</p>
		<p> HUIS. (Afrikaans). Also referred to as Tuiste.  See under HOUSE.</p>
		<p> HUISHOUDING. See under HOUSEHOLD.</p>
		<p> HUT. Generic term applied to basic rural  shelters and farm structures. The Concise Oxford Dictionary has defined it as a  &quot;small mean house of rude construction&quot;. Thus care should be  exercised not to extend its meaning to cover more substantial rural dwellings  nor structures constructed in alternative technologies.</p>
