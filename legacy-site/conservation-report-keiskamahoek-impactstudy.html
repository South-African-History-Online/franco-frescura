	    KEISKAMMAHOEK
	    CONSERVATION IMPACT STUDY</h5>
	  <p>Final report, November 1987</p>
	  <p>Franco  Frescura </p>
	  <h5>INTRODUCTION</h5>
	  <p>This  project was initiated in April 1983, when a representative of the New  York-based firm, Fine Art Corporate Services (FACS) approached the Centre for Housing  Research (CHORE), at the University of the Witwatersrand, was by a. They  suggested that, in their opinion, no open air museum or, as they put it,  culture park facilities, relevant to the economic realities of southern Africa had been developed in this country to date. FACS  indicated that they specialized in this type of work and wished to initiate a  project in the context of local rural culture. The Ciskei had been chosen as the  probable siting of a prototypical scheme which, if successful, could act as a  model for similar developments in other regions.</p>
	  <p>Initially  CHORE expressed some considerable reservations in regard to the location of the  project. Previous field research had shown the Ciskei to be an area stripped of  all but the most vestigial remnants of its traditional material and  architectural heritage. It was also a &quot;homeland&quot;, an area set  aside for sole Black residence as early as 1913 (Davenport and Hunt, 1974).  Thus its government was not only inextricably linked to an Apartheid philosophy,  inimical to civilized behaviour but, in more recent times, it had also become a  dumping ground used by the South African government to forcibly resettle many  of the Black residents of the Eastern Cape who had previously made their homes  in so-called White areas. As a result some villages had become little  better than rural slums where unemployment and starvation were endemic, a  factor stressed by the Desmond study of 1969 which estimated that the residents  of the Ciskei village of Mnxesha were subsisting on food rations valued at  R2.30 per month (Desmond, 1969). The Herman/Windham study of 1985 also  established that between 1970 and 1983 the infant mortality for the  Transkei/Ciskei region was 130 per 1000 as against a figure of 22 for South  African Whites as a whole. This meant that approximately one in every five  infants born in the region would die before they reached the age of five  (Herman and Windham, 1985).</p>
	  <p>After  prolonged discussions with both colleagues and community leaders, it was  decided to undertake this brief, with the following provisos:</p>
	  <ul>
        <li>that  the project be orientated towards economic development and the generation of  job opportunities in the region.</li>
	    <li>that  the tourist component become incidental to the provision of a wider educational  facility to also be used by the residents of the region themselves.</li>
	    <li>that  the resultant buildings fall within the cultural parameters and economic  realities of the region.</li>
	    <li>that  contact with officials of the Ciskei Regional Authority be kept to the  necessary minimum.</li>
	    </ul>
	  <p>Such a  project also promised to break new ground in the field of museum development in  southern Africa and its planning, and  radically depart from similar schemes elsewhere in the country (Frescura,  1986). Understandably these proposals did not meet with the wholehearted  support of the museum establishment in the eastern Cape. Brian Wilmot, Director of the Albany Museum  in Grahamstown, slated them as being eurocentric. He also proceeded to  recouch them in his own terminology and put himself forward as consultant for  the project (Ciskei Tourist Board, 1985).</p>
	  <p>Manton  Hirst, Anthropological Curator of the Kaffrarian Museum in King William's Town  was somewhat more vitriolic in his comments, describing the First Interim  Report to be &quot;as articulate as that of a rattlesnake&quot; (pers  comm, 17 February 1984). Despite such opposition (and mixed metaphors!) the  Ciskei Directorate of Planning supported the initial concepts (Frescura, 1984)  and commissioned the work to proceed. However even at this early stage it  became apparent to all concerned with the project that its economic viability  would depend largely upon its siting and relation to potential markets. Dr  David Bridgeman, Presidential Economic Advisor, also expressed some misgivings  at its feasibility should it be located in a rural area and suggested that the  possibility of linking the development to an established urban infrastructure  should be closely examined (Memorandum from Dr DHM Bridgeman to Mr R Louw,  FACS, 14 February 1984).</p>
	  <p>Following  the initial feasibility study extensive consideration was given to the  potential siting of the project. Although the concept of an ideal site  had been developed at an early stage, this was modified in terms of Bridgeman's  comments and a number of urban areas were also included in the survey. Finally  a short list of ten potential locations was drawn up. These were:</p>
	  <ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Whittlesea  village centre</li>
          <li>Thaba  Ka Ndoda, on the road between Dimbaza and Keiskammahoek</li>
          <li>Keiskammahoek,  on the hillside overshadowing the town</li>
          <li>Keiskammahoek  village centre</li>
          <li>Keiskammahoek,  on the road north to St Mathews</li>
          <li>Outside  King William's Town, on the road to Bisho</li>
          <li>Road  between King William's Town and Peddie</li>
          <li>Peddie  village centre</li>
          <li>Coastal  road, near Hamburg</li>
          <li>Coastal  road, nearing Port Alfred</li>
        </ul>
	    </ul>
	  <p>These  were assessed according to a number of criteria including educational, economic  and tourist potential. As a result it was found that, although the King  William's Town-Bisho site presented the best commercial and tourist potential,  this gave rise to problems of over-centralisation in the Bisho district.  Keiskammahoek, on the other hand served a large rural community with extensive  unemployment problems, was endowed with a service infrastructure, badly needed  additional educational facilities and thus offered the best potential for new  economic development.</p>
	  <p>At  this stage the Ciskei Directorate of Planning offered FACS a site south of  Keiskammahoek on a hillside overlooking the village. At the same time the  Ciskei Tourist and Holiday Trust (not to be confused with the Ciskei National  Tourist Office, or CINTO) commissioned CHORE to conduct a conservation impact  study of Keiskammahoek in order to assess its historical and cultural value to  local tourism. This was undertaken in conjunction with Dr (now Professor)  Dennis Radford of the Department of Architecture, University of the Witwatersrand. The results of this report, which have  been included in this study, indicated that not only was Keiskammahoek a  settlement of considerable historical importance, but that its growth was the result  of a number of cultural inputs, Khoikhoi, Xhosa, Mfengu, British and German. It  was the focal point of a large rural community, it had an established  infrastructure, a resident managerial component and a small but expandable  light industrial centre. It was also possessed of a number of historically  important but underused buildings. The report recommended that the objectives  of cultural preservation, economic growth and architectural conservation could  best be met by interweaving the functions of the project into the existing  social fabric of the village (Frescura and Radford, 1984).</p>
	  <p>Although  the Frescura/Radford findings were accepted by FACS and the Ciskei's  Directorate of Planning incorporated them into their long-term development  plans for the region (Ciskei Directorate of Planning, 1984), responsibility for  the planning of a Ciskei Cultural Centre was handed over to the Ciskei National  Tourist Office (CINTO). This body, which had been reconstituted three times  since the inception of this project, barely eighteen months previously, met  with representatives of FACS, CHORE and the Albany Museum  in February 1985. At that meeting it proposed to continue with the development  of a Cultural Museum  but, at the instigation of the Albany   Museum, decided to locate  it at Thaba ka Ndoda. Although this site had previously been assessed by this  study to be unfeasible in almost every single aspect relevant to a policy of  economic development, CINTO was guided in its choice by a concern to reinforce  facilities already existing at the site which, since their construction in  1981, had proved to be economically unworkable and singularly unpopular with  the people of the Ciskei. It is also relevant to note that at that time CINTO's  Board consisted of thirteen white and three black members. As the direct result  of this decision, CHORE found its position in this project to be untenable and  withdrew from the project. It is believed that FACS followed suit soon  afterwards for similar reasons.</p>
	  <p>The  final chapter of this research saga was written in April and May 1985 when 59  architectural students from the University   of Port Elizabeth  descended upon Keiskammahoek and measured up 39 structures considered to be of  major architectural and historical importance. This was not done out of any  sense of altruism but rather in the knowledge that most of these buildings were  in the process of being lost through neglect and vandalism and should be  recorded for the sake of future generations.</p>
	  <p>The  value of this report will therefore be perceived to lie in two major areas.  Firstly it is the record of an attempt to break down many of the cultural  barriers and eurocentric prejudices which surround museum practices in this  country. The concept of culture as a generator of economic activity cannot be  overlooked in a region where current neo-colonial attitudes dictate that the  values of the former should be sacrificed for the expedience of the latter. The  fallacy of such an argument has been known in Europe for many years and is now  slowly being discovered in North America where  the financial opportunities created by historical built environments are  becoming an important component of local and national economies.</p>
	  <p>Secondly  this report is the record of a small village created by military and missionary,  by capitalist traders and colonial officials, by emigre British and  German settlers, in a region dominated by Xhosa, Mfengu and Khoikhoi groups.  The result is a curious mix of all of these cultures, each informing the other,  creating an architecture which is both colonial and yet modest enough to fall  within the economic realities of the region. Since the onset of Ciskei independence in 1981 most of the  buildings in Keiskammahoek have passed into the ownership of the Ciskei regional  authority who has let them, largely to civil servants. As the result the  village buildings are undergoing extensive changes almost daily. Sash windows  are being replaced with steel units, fretted timber fascias with asbestos  panels and yellowwood floors with cement screed. However, before the  conservative-minded reader passes judgment upon the new owners, let him  remember that the plunder of Keiskammahoek was begun by its original White  inhabitants before they left in 1981. The library's stock of books was  distributed out among the locals, the hotel's antique collection sold to yuppie  socialites from Cape Town and Johannesburg, the gravestones plundered by  curio hunters and the cast-iron trims removed to King William's Town. The only  reason why the military sabers remain atop the village hall and HMS Thunderer's  cannon kept its place before the village school is because the former were  found to be fakes and the latter proved too heavy to be moved.</p>
	  <h5>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</h5>
	  <p>Numerous  people have assisted in this project and the production of its report. Foremost  amongst them was Professor Dennis Radford who, as colleague and friend,  contributed much valuable advice and took part in the early stages of  conservation research. Beverley Peters, Clerk of Keiskammahoek, made available  to us the village's archives, extended welcome hospitality and provided much  local information. More recently the Historical Curator of the Kaffrarian Museum, Denver Webb, has permitted use  of personal research data and has conducted a number of field interviews on my  behalf. The measured survey of the buildings of Keiskammahoek was made by  architectural students of the University   of Port Elizabeth. Their  individual contributions are acknowledged in the text where appropriate.  Lesley-Anne Morton typed her fingers to the bone and gave much welcome support.  My grateful thanks go to all of them.</p>

	  <p>KEISKAMMAHOEK CONSERVATION IMPACT STUDY</p>
	  <p>FIRST  PRELIMINARY REPORT</p>
	  <p>Franco  Frescura and Dennis Radford </p>
	  <h5>INTRODUCTION</h5>
	  <p>This  survey was instigated by the Ciskei Tourist Corporation and was made possible  by a generous personal financial contribution by Mr John Bridgeman. It was  undertaken by two members of the Department of Architecture of the University  of the Witwatersrand, Dr Dennis Radford and  Franco Frescura, who visited Keiskammahoek for the period 19-21 June 1984 with  a view to identifying buildings and sites of architectural and historical  importance.</p>
	  <p>In  conducting their survey, they identified these elements and noted in what way  they form groups. Certain problems were discerned but the potential of the  village is seen to outweigh these. However, some problems of a larger scale  will also need to be tackled if this potential is to be fully exploited with  justice for all. Informal interviews were also held with various public  officials and prominent members of the community. Finally, this report ends  with a series of immediate recommendations.</p>
	  <h5>METHODOLOGY OF SURVEY</h5>
	  <ul>
        <li>The  team inspected each building within the settlement, including other places of  interest, such as the cemetery. An initial assessment of every building was  made.</li>
	    <li>Those  identified as being of architectural/historical value were recorded on a  standard form of which two samples are attached as an appendix. As can be seen  from these, information regarding the building's condition, age and potential  are recorded so as to inform the assessment process.</li>
	    <li>Every  building was photographed for record purposes.</li>
	    <li>A  simple grading system was adopted. This contains two categories: two star, for  important buildings in good condition; one star, for less important buildings  or those in bad condition.</li>
	    <li>Potential  groups were also plotted on a base map.</li>
	    </ul>
	  <h5>BUILDINGS OF ARCHITECTURAL  AND HISTORICAL VALUE</h5>
	  <ul>
        <li>Of  a total of 125 buildings in the village, 48 were identified as being of either  architectural or historical merit. 18 were provisionally classed as two-star  while the remaining 30 were placed in the one star category. This means that  over one third of the building stock is worthy of preservation and restoration,  a high proportion. (See Map One).</li>
	    <li>Most  of these buildings line the main street, forming a group with a distinct  character. A further group was identified around the old mill. (See Map Two).</li>
	    <li>A  very broad range of building types was noted including seven churches, a  library, a hotel, shops and a village hall, but the minority were single  storied houses ranging from a small pioneer cottage to substantial villas. In  age too these varied from late 19th century through to the 1920s.  Thus a broad representative historic spectrum is available within the village.</li>
	    </ul>
	  <h5>PROBLEMS WITH THE EXISTING  FABRIC</h5>
	  <ul>
        <li>Some  buildings, notably the churches, library and village hall, appear to be disused  or underused. New compatible uses will have to be found.</li>
	    <li>Other  buildings are suffering from structural decay, verandahs are falling apart, and  decorative trim is rotting away.</li>
	    <li>Yet  other buildings have been inappropriately altered or have unsympathetic  additions. (See Map Three).</li>
	    </ul>
	  <h5>POTENTIAL FOR CONSERVATION</h5>
	  <ul>
        <li>Although  almost all of the classified buildings will require some form of restoration,  in the main this need not be unduly expensive as most of the buildings are  relatively small.</li>
	    <li>Attention  should also be paid to the restoration of a building's context, that is to say,  of their garden walls, trees and planting.</li>
	    <li>As  most of the buildings are domestic, a re-housing policy with some form of  control should ensure that they continue to serve a social purpose. The  potential of the larger buildings such as the hall, library and the churches,  should be investigated. Some could serve as specialist museums, while others  would make good craft centres.</li>
	    <li>The  remains of the Old Fort would make an excellent museum of local military  history.</li>
	    <li>The  old cemetery could, with minimum restoration, become a tourist attraction.</li>
	    <li>The  old village hall could serve as a local history museum.</li>
	    <li>The  old farmhouse next to the Nettleton   Bridge would make an  excellent open-air farm museum.</li>
	    <li>The  present hotel could be restored and upgraded to serve as a tourist base.</li>
	    <li>The  old mill plus the sheds around it could extend its present function as a  manufacturer of yellowwood furniture, and thus serve as yet another attraction.</li>
	    <li>The  upgrading and restoration of the rest of the village along the line of the Main Street would  provide a charming context for the above.</li>
	    <li>All  of the above are either already viable or would require only a relatively  modest outlay to be presentable. Most are in the possession of the Ciskei  Government.</li>
	    </ul>
	  <h5>BUILDINGS OF INTEREST IN  KEISKAMMAHOEK</h5>
	  <p>The Old  Fort. Although it is much altered, the Old Fort retains much of its character.  Originally part of the extensive military camp at Keiskammahoek, the present  building is believed to have flanked the tall central tower that dominated and  defended the smaller buildings around it. Latterly it served as a jail but now  is disused and neglected. As it stands a modest programme of restoration would  put it back into good condition. In addition it is of an ideal size and  configuration to serve as a museum of local military history.</p>
	  <p>Ballantines  Mill is a large historic range of buildings which originally formed the nucleus  of a thriving wagon making business. Furniture made from the local indigenous  woods is still manufactured here but, according to the owner, production is  limited by the lack of a tarred road. The buildings, with their gables and  belfry, form a striking landmark in the village. Like the fort, not much  restoration appears to be necessary. In the report it is envisaged that their  present use be expanded and that they act as the center of a craft orientated  light industrial area.</p>
	  <h5>NON-HISTORICAL OR IRRELEVANT  BUILDINGS</h5>
	  <p>These  can be classified into two groups. The first group is made up of those situated  away from the historic core and therefore outside the concern of this report.  The second group consists of those within the core which will need some form of  architectural treatment to bring them into sympathy with the older buildings.  The garage on the Main Street  is an example of this. Again this need not be very expensive to achieve.</p>
	  <h5>LANDSCAPING</h5>
	  <p>The  existing landscaping, principally the lines of trees along the roads, add  considerably to the character of the village. This should be preserved and  extended. The water courses should also be preserved and maintained. New  landscaping should be undertaken to enhance any new buildings.</p>
	  <h5>LARGER CONCERNS</h5>
	  <p>Keiskammahoek  is beautifully situated in attractive natural surroundings. It has enormous  potential as an overnight stop for foreign tourists. It is envisaged that these  tourists could be included in a greater Eastern  Province and Ciskei tour  package which could be added to the present popular Garden Route tour. The tour would begin  in Port Elizabeth and end in East   London. A very rich itinerary could be arranged.</p>
	  <p>However,  a tarred link with the King William's Town-Alice road is a necessity if this  route is to be used by coaches. This need not, and in fact should not, be too  elaborate a road: a &quot;touch of Africa&quot;  would add some excitement to arrival in the village.</p>
	  <p>The  whole question of the future development of the village as a growth point needs  to be carefully studied, as any large unsympathetic developments could easily  destroy its character and thus nullify any restoration work done. Quantities of  small thoughtless changes would also negatively affect its character.</p>
	  <p>The  socio-economic implications of a restoration programme needs examination so  that its benefits can be shared out among the local population in the greatest  degree. Consideration should be given to training teams of local building craftsmen  to undertake the restoration, thus upgrading skills and building up expertise.</p>
	  <h5>RECOMMENDATIONS</h5>
	  <ul>
        <li>The  village of Keiskammahoek has a rich architectural  and historical heritage which is virtually unknown. Its potential for tourism  should be recognised.</li>
	    <li>A  programme of restoration and preservation should be embarked upon as soon as  possible.</li>
	    <li>To  further this programme, a more detailed inspection of each building identified  in this survey should be undertaken, principally for budget purposes.</li>
	    <li>The  town and its environment should be declared a special area so that all  decisions regarding its fabric will be made by a co-ordinating body.</li>
	    <li>A  more comprehensive study should be commissioned to investigate the  socio-economic implications and possibilities of the restoration programme. A  major element of such a brief must be the investigation and formulation of  future land use strategies for the village as a whole. In view of the various  activities which may possibly in future centre upon this area. This would be  paramount in order to provide the various bodies with a larger strategy within  which a number of different activities could be facilitated.</li>
	    </ul>
	  <h5>APPENDIX B</h5>
	  <h5>KEISKAMMAHOEK CRAFT CENTRE</h5>
	  <p>FIRST  PRELIMINARY REPORT</p>
	  <p>Franco  Frescura </p>
	  <h5>HISTORY  OF THE PROJECT</h5>
	  <p>At its  onset this project envisaged a series of buildings of an educational and  cultural nature set in a semi-rural park-like environment. It was intended that  the planning of the site and the architectural forms achieved would have set  out to evoke the spirit of traditional Xhosa architecture whilst not  necessarily employing the same building technologies.</p>
	  <p>The  concept was then extended in an attempt to make such a centre economically  viable and even self-reliant. This included such activities as craft manufacture  and marketing, social and entertainment areas and a strong tourist potential. A  number of possible sites were surveyed throughout the Ciskei and  ultimately the conclusion was arrived at that the success of such a venture  would depend largely upon its relationship to population areas and arterial  routes. In consequence focus was then concentrated upon the Keiskammahoek  region as a desirable location for such development.</p>
	  <p>It must be  mentioned that throughout these initial stages, thinking has been supported by  a strong underlay of social concern. The developmental, self-help, job creation  and educational potential of this project has been an area of primary interest.  Finally the idea of including residential facilities within the project was  mooted. This brought the concept of such a centre out of its original, and  possibly too idyllic, context and has set it firmly in or near an urban area  where an existing service infrastructure could be extended to include these  additional facilities. At this stage it was decided that the planning of the  project should also take into consideration the present facilities and future  potential of Keiskammahoek itself. This report therefore concentrates upon the  feasibility of the development of Keiskammahoek and its relationship to this  project.</p>
	  <h5>SITE ANALYSIS: THE OFFERED  SITE</h5>
	  <p>A site  immediately south of the village   of Keiskammahoek on the  opposite side of the river has been suggested for possible development. This  was investigated and found to be unsuitable in a number of respects. These  included:</p>
	  <ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Its  steep slope, in some parts being as high as 1:3 and in many others being only a  fractionally better 1:4. This was not only unsuitable to the design envisaged  but it also militated against the limited budget set aside for the project.</li>
          <li>The  location of the site in respect to the village is visually dramatic but it is  also potentially detrimental to any future development in Keiskammahoek itself.  It is set aside from and before it and does not encourage through traffic and  occasional shopping from potential visitors.</li>
          <li>The  access link between village and centre is tenuous and achieved only via a  roundabout road route too long for most pedestrians and hence requiring the use  of private vehicles. The only alternative is the construction of a long and  relatively expensive pedestrian bridge over the Keiskamma River  and its not inconsiderable flood plain. The subsequent climb up to the Centre  might also prove a deterrent to some potential visitors.</li>
        </ul>
	    </ul>
	  <p>It  would therefore not be incorrect to state that this site would offer both the  Centre and the village a close physical proximity without either deriving the  full benefit of each other's presence.</p>
	  <h5>PROPOSALS  FOR ALTERNATIVE SITES</h5>
	  <p>During  the course of the Conservation Survey, there was a growing awareness that any  project which sought to stimulate and complement economic development within  the village should not be located outside of it but should ideally be  interwoven within its physical and social fabric. This would have a number of  advantages:</p>
	  <ul>
        <li>The  project would not stand outside and independent of events in the village but  would become part of its everyday existence and economic life.</li>
	    <li>It  would be easily accessible to visitors and locals alike.</li>
	    <li>It  would make full use of an existing service reticulation and human  infrastructure without these requiring expensive extension.</li>
	    <li>It  would provide a source of local employment.</li>
	    <li>The  presence of a tourist-orientated draw-card would provide the impetus for other  fringe economic activities.</li>
	    <li>The  fragmentation of the project functions would allow potentially unfeasible or  unsuccessful elements to be identified more rapidly thus allowing for immediate  remedial action to be taken.</li>
	    <li>The  same fragmentation would allow a more extensive and imaginative use of existing  vacant or under-utilised facilities within the village.</li>
	    <li>The  presence of certain facilities within the village would make the restoration of  its historic architectural character a more attractive economic proposition,  thus becoming a potential tourist draw-card in its own right.</li>
	    <li>The  use of existing structures within the village for such functions as craft  manufacture, craft marketing and cultural activities would free some of the  budget for other and possibly more pressing uses such as the preservation of some  of the more threatened domestic structures.</li>
	    </ul>
	  <h5>PROPOSALS FOR SPECIFIC  FUNCTIONS AND USES</h5>
	  <ul>
        <li>It  is proposed to create various areas of historical interest in some of the  larger and under-utilised public buildings. These include:</li>
	    <li>a  restored pioneer cottage</li>
	    <li>a  missionary museum</li>
	    <li>a  military museum, the site for which is self-evident</li>
	    <li>a  local history museum</li>
	    <li>an  agricultural museum</li>
	    <li>The  creation of a central village or civic space in the area immediately south of  the existing Post Office and bus stops. A new local government and service  centre, sympathetically designed, could be located here as well as a popular,  informal sector marketing facility.</li>
	    <li>The  establishment of various craft centres about the village. Marketing of their  products could be done either internally or through shops located on the main  strip, which the Conservation Study has recommended for special development.</li>
	    <li>Further  to this, but outside the area of the initial brief, is the establishment of a  small light industrial area centering upon the existing furniture factory and  related buildings. It is necessary to add at this point that the development of  a tar road link between Keiskammahoek and King William's Town will be necessary  not only to promote tourist access but also if the village is to retain the  small light industrial component it already has. Fortunately the existing  gravel road is in good condition and does not appear to necessitate the  construction of any major bridges and roadworks.</li>
	    <li>The  new educational/cultural facility could be located between the cemetery and the  school. The open air architectural museum could then be located on the other  side of the road to its west.</li>
	    </ul>
	  <h5>CONCLUSIONS</h5>
	  <p>The  above points deal only with those issues which arise directly out of the  original project brief itself. A number of other ideas however have also come  out of the Conservation Study and therefore this report should be read in  conjunction with it.</p>
	  <p>It is  however necessary to point out that, should the wider implications of this  report be accepted, then it would be shortsighted to omit any project component  within Keiskammahoek itself out of a broad architectural brief. The historical  revalidation of the village should be considered within a larger social and  economic as well as environmental context and lack of co-ordination in one area  could jeopardise the success of others.</p>
	  <h5>POSTSCRIPT</h5>
	  <p>This report has never been made available for public consumption.  Today the survey is dated and largely irrelevant, except, perhaps, as a  historical text. Its drawings, however, detailed by students of architecture,  at the University   of Port Elizabeth (as it  was then known), document an architectural heritage which has long since  disappeared, and thus warrants publication.
