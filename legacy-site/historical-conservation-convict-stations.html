	  CONVICT STATIONS AND THE CAPE  COLONIAL POST OFFICE</h5>
	  <p align="left">Franco Frescura</p>
	  <p>The exploitation of convict labour at the Cape during the Colonial  era is closely connected with the work of John Montagu, Colonial Secretary for  the Cape 1843-53. Montagu began his career as  a colonial administrator in 1834, when he was appointed Colonial Secretary to  Van Diemen&rsquo;s Land, later known as Tasmania  which, at that time, was one of the largest penal colonies operated by the  British. There he gained a reputation as a brutal administrator and, after a  disagreement with the Governor, Sir John Franklin, accepted the post of  Colonial Secretary for the Cape, which he held from 25 April 1843 until just  before his death in 1853. He was a staunch Anglican, and it is obvious that  many of his policies towards convicts were firmly grounded in the puritan  belief that correction ought to be brought about through a mixture of a  protestant work ethic and religious proselytizing.</p>
	  <p>On 18 December 1843 Montagu was ordered by Governor Napier to visit  Robben Island, for the purpose of &ldquo;inquiring  into the working of the convict system at that penal station&rdquo;. As a result  he put forward a plan which would consolidate the various mental institutions  and lazaretti of the Colony upon the island, and would remove the major part of  its convicts to work camps upon the mainland. Following the experience he had  gained in Tasmania,  it was Montagu&rsquo;s intention that no convict should be detained upon the island &ldquo;whose  crime, conduct and character do not require a more severe degree of discipline  and punishment than that which is observed at the convict road station&rdquo;.  Instead convicts were to be removed from their places of incarceration, whose  upkeep was a drain upon the fiscus, and placed into work camps where they were  expected to engage their labour, for free, on road building and maintenance  projects.</p>
	  <p>In 1844 Montagu&rsquo;s plan was accepted, and the removal of the  chronically sick, lepers, lunatics and paupers to Robben Island  was completed by November 1845. By 1857 there were about 720 convict camps  scattered about the Colony. These were housed in temporary barracks, capable of  being easily dismantled and moved to new locations as the need arose. After  working hours, convicts were given basic schooling, with a heavy emphasis upon  religious. However the larger of these camps also housed non-convict labourers,  as well as their supervisors, and it is apparent that a number of additional  facilities were included for their benefit, such as the use of a postal  establishment.</p>
	  <p>From the outset of his arrival at the Cape,  Montagu propounded that the establishment of an efficient road infrastructure  for the Colony would open up communication and trade with the interior, and was  thus an important precondition to its economic development. To achieve this, he  needed a source of cheap labour and, given the depleted state of the Cape treasury at that time, convicts were seen as a  logical solution to his problem. In this work, Montagu had the benefit of the  support of two skilled road designers and land surveyors: Col Charles Michell  and Andrew Geddes Bain. Michell was born in England  in 1793, commanded a brigade during the Napoleonic wars, fought at the Battle  of Waterloo, and subsequently became Professor in the science of fortification  at the Royal Military Academy,  at Woolwich. In 1828 he was appointed the Colony&rsquo;s first Surveyor-General,  Civil Engineer, and Superintendent of Public Works. He was a brilliant  architect, who is credited with the design of many important buildings at the Cape, and played a leading role in the planning and  construction of a number of its roads. He retired in 1848 when he returned to England on  pension. Bain was an equally multi-talented personality. Initially he trained  as a saddler, took part in numerous trading expeditions into the southern  African interior, wrote popular verse, and in 1836 was attached to the Royal  Engineers. A natural, if untrained engineer, he constructed a number of  military roads and passes on the eastern frontier, before undertaking a pioneer  study of southern Africa&rsquo;s geology and making several important fossil  discoveries (SESA 1972).</p>
	  <p>Of the 720-odd convict camps believed to have been in existence  during the 1850s, only twenty-two of these are conclusively known to have  incorporated a postal facility as part of their establishments. This means that  the other seven hundred camps were either too small to warrant a post office in  their own right, or did not have an administrator of sufficient seniority to be  entrusted with the running of a post office, or were located in the vicinity of  an existing postal establishment. Although the majority of these camps probably  fell into this latter category, it must be assumed that at least some must have  enjoyed equal standing with the twenty-two listed below, and must therefore  have had access to a postal service in their own right. If this was indeed the  case, then no direct record of their establishments has been discovered to  date.</p>
	  <p>The position of postmaster on a convict station usually fell to  the Master of Stores, who was issued with &ldquo;an obliterating stamp&rdquo; to  process postal matter. At least two such instruments have been documented to  date: Wagonmaker&rsquo;s Valley, which used the octagon numeral 15, and Howison&rsquo;s  Poort, which used a barred triangle obliterator. Being dumb, these could easily  be transferred from location to location without necessitating a change of name  or the expense of providing their postmasters with an engraved office date  stamp. A similar policy of &ldquo;wanderstempels&rdquo; was also employed  subsequently by the Cape GPO for temporary post offices in Basutoland and on  the Kimberley diamond fields, and may have also been applied to the Cape&rsquo;s  Field-Cornet&rsquo;s Posts.</p>
	  <p>One clue to the presence of additional  convict station post offices may lie with the existence of a number of postal  establishments during the 1849-74 period, which were listed as agencies, but  which were quite obviously run by field-cornets. These establishments were  listed in the Civil Establishment Blue Books from 1849 through to 1874, when  all reference to them vanished from Post Office lists. Many of them were  short-lived; had a penchant to disappear from the Blue Books, and then  mysteriously reappear for a year or two only to vanish into oblivion; or to  change their names at short notice, often two or three times within the short  period of five years. This is not the behavior expected of a Field-Cornet&rsquo;s  Post, which was usually of a much more permanent nature, but would be  consistent with an establishment given to impermanence, and removal at short  notice, such as a road crew. Not all of these convict stations would have been  large enough to warrant the appointment of a dedicated postmaster, nor, for  that matter, would they have supported a thriving postal business, given the  levels of literacy existing at that time. It is feasible therefore, that the  collection and delivery of mails to temporary road camps would have been  charged to a local official, whose duties already included the provision of a  rudimentary postal service to isolated farm homesteads.</p>
	  <p>Given all of the above, it now appears probable that the series of  seemingly irrational movements of postmasters, the unpredictable appearances  and disappearances of post offices ad their staff, and the endless changes of names,  locations and divisions which blight the Colonial listings, were not the result  of indifferent documentation, bureaucratic incompetence or the impermanence of  staff. Rather, it can now be argued that many of these were temporary post  offices which were attached to the nearest existing field-cornetcy, on a  short-term basis, to service the needs of convict labor camps. The formation  and location of such camps would not have been subject to Post Office planning,  but would rather have been ordered by the planning needs and functional work  requirements of the Public Works Department, leaving the GPO to passively  document such information as the PWD saw fit to pass on to them.</p>
	  <h5>THE CASE OF HENRY FANCOURT WHITE, CAPE  ROADS ENGINEER</h5>
	  <p>The village of Blanco was established on the farm Modder River  during construction of the Montagu   Pass in 1844-1847.  Initially it was a work camp which included an assembly of workshops, stores  and housing for convict workers and their supervisors. Almost from the onset it  appears to have been known as Blanco, a pun based on the name of Henry Fancourt  White, the engineer in charge of the project. White was an Australian who was  brought out to the Cape by the Colonial Secretary, John Montagu, for the  purpose of building the pass, and he continued to work in the Cape  after the completion of the project. When he retired in 1860 he purchased the  camp and laid it out as a formal township, which made provision for a school, a  hotel and other public facilities. Although he intended to name it White's  Villa, the name of Blanco appears to have stuck.</p>
	  <p>In 1844 work was also begun on the construction of a new road  through the Zuurberg Pass, and in 1847 the convict station, which had  previously been established during construction of the Montagu Pass,  was transferred to the Zuurberg. The Zuurberg Range lies on the boundary  between the divisions of Alexandria and Somerset East, and straddles across the  main wagon route from Port Elizabeth to Cradock The road, which travels through  the Pass, was generally considered by early visitors to be an &quot;almost  impassable mountain&quot;, and made it difficult for farming communities in  the South African interior to maintain regular contact with the coast.</p>
	  <p>The road crew included the project engineer, Henry Fancourt White,  as well as his entire support staff. Construction took 250 convicts two years  to complete, at a cost of &#8356;20,000. Their first camp was located at the northern  end of the pass, possibly near a wagon halt initially known as Grobbelaar&rsquo;s,  and subsequently renamed Ann&rsquo;s Villa.</p>
	  <p>In 1851, following the outbreak of the 1850-53 frontier war, the  convict camp was removed to the safety of Port Elizabeth where, under White&rsquo;s  direction, it was engaged in the construction of a number of projects. These  included a road linking the commercial strip of Main Street to the residential Central  area, subsequently named White&rsquo;s Road, a road to Uitenhage, and a bridge over  the Baakens River. By 1853 the threat of war had  receded, and the convict station returned to the Zuurberg. Work on the road  continued for some years thereafter, and when White retired to Blanco in 1860  the camp was moved to a site on the Boontjes   River, some two  kilometers south of the pass, where a free wagon outspan was located.  The project was probably completed early in 1865, when the camp was removed to  a new project.</p>
	  <p>The work of Fancourt White very clearly illustrates the historical  continuities and transitions which took place when a road crew, together with  its postal establishment, was moved either from one project to the next, or,  when engaged upon the same project, from one site to the next. The composition  of the road gang remained essentially the same, but the name of its postal  establishment in the Post Office records was changed according to its location.  The study also illustrates the silences which occurred in the historical record  when, for whatever reason, a road crew moved into an urban area, or into the  sphere of an established postal establishment, and its post office was  temporarily closed. This is important, for although most historians will  happily record the achievements involved in the spanning of a river, or the  scaling of a mountain range, the drudgery of common-day road building is  scarcely ever mentioned. It seems probable that further research into the  postal system, most particularly its field-cornet&rsquo;s posts, will provide a clear  picture of this hitherto unrecorded aspect of colonial life.</p>
	  <p>During the  course of current research the following postal establishments have been linked  to convict road gangs or convict stations. The data listed below includes the  name of the post office, its magisterial division, as well as it known dates of  opening and closing:</p>

	  <h5>POSTSCRIPT</h5>
	  <p>Sometime in December 2001 I was  proofreading the last drafts of my book on the Cape Colonial Post Office, when  the thought struck me that, although the military post offices, the sea-going  Ocean post offices, and the railway&rsquo;s travelling post offices had each been  given their own consolidated listing in my text, the same facility had not been  extended to the postal establishments attached to the Colony&rsquo;s convict  stations. At the height of this programme, which was established by John  Montagu in 1844 in order to use convict labour to extend the Colony&rsquo;s road  infrastructure, some 700 stations were in existence. Although most must have  been small and transient in nature, many others incorporated among their staff a  complement of road engineers, administration clerks, stores managers and a  number of supervisors, none of whom would have been convict labourers, and some  who would have been required by the nature of their work, to keep in regular  postal contact with their management in Cape Town. This mail must have been  collected, and delivered by return, probably by means of Field-Cornets, whose  role in the Cape postal infrastructure has, to  date, remained largely unexplained. Thus, although a search through my research  notes has produced a very short list of only 22 post offices, it is probable  that the actual number must be over a hundred, at the very least. However,  given the undocumented nature of Field-Cornets&rsquo; posts, this aspect of the Post  Office will have to remain a matter of conjecture until further research has  been concluded.</p>
