        <h5>A  VENDA  SKETCH-BOOK</h5>
        <p>Franco Frescura</p>
	      <p>The  Venda are a group who inhabit the region immediately south of the Limpopo  River, on the northern borders of South Africa&rsquo;s Limpopo Province, and are more  closely associated with the Shona of southern Zimbabwe. Historically their  domestic architecture has consisted primarily of circular dwellings surrounded  by deep verandahs, but in more recent times they have been replaced by a set of  wide eaves.</p>
	      <p>Although  their circular dwellings were very similar in form to those built by their  Tswana, Pedi and Tsonga neighbours, they differ substantially in their method  of construction. Before the 1920s, when restrictions began to be placed in the  region upon the indiscriminate cutting of indigenous trees, their building was  timber intensive. The conical roof, consisting of an almost solid body of mopane wood was taken radially to a  central apex marked by a finial, supported temporarily by a central post. The  roof was raised upon a solid drum of mopane  posts placed in close order in a circle some 4-6 metres in diameter. Additional  support to the roof was given at the eaves, where a series of evenly spaced  timber columns carried a timber ring-beam which, in its turn, carried the roof  structure. The inner drum was also strengthened against torque by a series of  sapling hoops placed internally and externally at roof, head and waist height.  The whole structure was then plastered, both internally and externally, with a  clay and cow dung mix, while a thatch cover was applied over the roof. Unlike  other parts of the country where the grass is applied in bundles &ldquo;seed-end up&rdquo;, the Venda separate their  grass into small bundles and bind the into a continuous loose &ldquo;skirt&rdquo; which is wound onto the roof  frame from the bottom up. The underside of the roof frame was often also  plastered and painted in a series of concentric decorative patterns, also known  as &ldquo;the eye of the lion&rdquo;. The back of  the verandah was often enclosed and used either for storage or as additional  sleeping quarters.</p>
	      <p>Today  a shortage of natural wood has curtailed the construction of such  timber-intensive structures, and although sun-dried clay bricks have now  replaced the timber drum, and the use of indigenous timbers in the roof frame  has been heavily rationalized, the verandah dwelling remains the predominant  domestic form in the region.</p>
	      <p>The homestead  architecture of the Venda  can be said to be unique in the context of southern Africa,  for while all other groups use a system of hierarchical differentiation based  upon the concept of &ldquo;left and right&rdquo;,  in their case all distinction is made in terms of &ldquo;front and back&rdquo;.  Often also, the concept of &ldquo;front&rdquo; is  synonymous with &ldquo;downhill&rdquo;, while &ldquo;back&rdquo; is used to mean &ldquo;uphill&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p>Such a differentiation becomes evident at the level of the  domestic unit, where the dwellings and activity centers of the wife, (or wives  in a polygamous union), will be located before and preferably downhill from  those of the father and family head. Similarly the homesteads of a man's sons  will be placed in front of and downhill from that of the parent. The settlement  of a Venda  Chief or Headman tends to follow the same basic pattern as that of his people,  except that the process of ascent to his quarters is complicated by the  introduction of defensive ramparts and narrow access passages, all designed to  protect his person in the case of attack. An old Venda proverb states that &quot;to climb a mountain you must follow a  zig-zag path&quot;, an obvious metaphor for their chiefs and the structure  of their society.</p>
	      <p>Venda settlement is also differentiated from  that of their neighbours in southern Africa by the fact that, in a polygamous  marriage, the Venda  father has a separate dwelling in his own right, with its own courtyards and,  in some cases, its own kitchen and granary. This contrasts sharply with the  practice of most other southern African groups where, under similar  circumstances, the dwelling of the first wife is recognised to be that of the  father. This also means that, with the exception of the Head Wife, no hierarchy  of settlement is followed in determining the position of second and subsequent  wives, the location of their dwellings being a matter of personal preference  and group negotiation.</p>
	      <p>Venda  wall decoration is based primarily upon stylized natural forms, especially  flowers and leaves. However a measure of geometrical decoration has also been  recorded, including zigzag, convex, wavy and blocked lines. More recent  additions include the symbols of hearts, clubs spades and diamonds commonly  found on playing cards. Some homesteads in central Venda have also developed a  tradition of wall sculpture, where the courtyards are marked by a series of  sculpted pilasters, often resembling faces, dwellings and military figures.</p>
	      <h5>POSTSCRIPT</h5>
        <p>This article was the result of a research  trip undertaken to  &nbsp;Venda in June 1989. The original only included  a few of the sketches reproduced here, and putting this small article on the  website has given me the opportunity of publishing the remainder as a group. To  date only a few have been finished off in ink, and, consequently, some of the  drawings might appear to be a little fuzzy. FRESCURA, Franco. Venda Sketch  Book.
