        <h5 align="left">THE ECOLOGY OF RURAL HABITAT</h5>
        <p align="left">Franco Frescura</p>
        <h5>INTRODUCTION</h5>
        <p>The creation of an indigenous architecture in southern Africa has always been part of a larger process whereby  both the individual dwelling unit and the larger homestead or village derive  their existence from the found and natural materials of the physical  environment. They use their immediate surrounds as a ready quarry for the  timber, the stones, the clay and the grass required for their construction.</p>
        <p>Theirs therefore is a highly functional kind of architecture which  uses materials according to their natural properties. As a result the form of  dwellings, the size of settlements and even the resolution of certain  structural details, such as the roof apex, have all been subjected to different  environmental forces leading to certain regions developing strong architectural  identities in their own right. In spite of these outward differences however,  all rural architecture is linked by the fact that this habitat is part of a  delicate environmental balance which brings together human settlement, economic  activity, physical environment and culture into one larger interacting whole.  Thus if one of vernacular architecture's attractions lies in its seeming  ability to merge with immediate surrounds, that is because it draws upon its  social and physical environs for its very being.</p>
        <h5>THE  ECOLOGY OF THE DWELLING UNIT</h5>
        <p>Traditionally the dwellings of rural southern Africa  have been built predominantly out of saplings, timber, clay, grass and cow  dung. Depending on the region, stone rubble and shales have also been used in  wall construction while natural lime has been found to be a good soil  stabiliser. However, being natural materials, these have also tended to provide  a home to a variety of insects, lizards and other small fauna which can subsist  alongside, or even in spite of, man. This has led to the rural dwelling  developing an internal ecological balance of its own, with man and his  activities on the one hand, providing a check to the infestation of his environment  on the other. Thus it was found, during the course of current research, that  when rural residents built fires in their dwellings for both heating and  cooking, their smoke rose and percolated through the thatch grass roof thus  effectively fumigating it and discouraging vermin infestation.</p>
        <p>To a certain extent this process must also be assumed to be  effective where clay walls are concerned. Therefore, should a family decide,  for any reason, to change their grass roof and replace it with zinc sheeting, they  will no longer be able to build an effective fire within it without the  assistance of a smoke flue. As in the majority of cases the flue has not found  popular application in the region's architecture, it is likely that this group  would soon cease to build internal fires in their dwelling thus terminating the  fumigating process. One probable result of this action will be that they will  need to introduce cement and brick into the structure in order to reduce or  eliminate infestation of the walls. Once a family initiates the use of cement,  it is also likely to cut down on its maintenance efforts by using this material  in the floor. However cement floors are hard and cold to sleep on and therefore  European- style furniture will have to be bought to replace traditional grass  sleeping mats. By implication then, such a family will be making a transition  from a local subsistence and craft- manufacturing economy to an externally  based cash-using society. However, in view of the fact that industrially  manufactured furniture is normally based upon a 90&deg;geometry  and that circular floor plans are thus difficult to furnish, a change in  fittings might also bring about a change in the dwelling's floor plan from the  circular to the square, thus also forcing a change in its roof technology.</p>
        <p>It is obviously highly unlikely that any individual rural family  will ever undergo such a methodical step-by-step evolution in their life-style  and economic status. Indeed this entire chain of events was built up from the  information obtained from various disparate and unrelated sources. Thus the  breakdown in traditional values described here need not necessarily begin at  the cessation of the fumigation process. The purchase of furniture would often  be of sufficient stimulus to bring about a change in the dwelling's floor plan  while in other recorded cases the cycle was broken when the family, tired of  the constant maintenance work required on the floor, replaced it with cement.  The old practice of recoating clay floors is necessary, for whilst the walls  and roof may be successfully maintained by fumigation and an occasional  re-plastering, the former needs to be resurfaced regularly every seven to ten  days or, at the most, within a fortnight. The material used is normally a  mixture of clay and cow dung which produces a warm, yielding and clean surface  suitable for laying sleeping mats on and, because of its ammonia content, it  also acts as a disinfecting agent.</p>
        <p>A final factor which requires consideration is the role played by  the vernacular dwelling within the larger environmental cycle of rural birth,  life and death. Generally speaking we find that the rural builder draws upon  the natural environment for his raw materials. These are given validity within  the structure but, once their function ceases, the dwelling is allowed to decay  and, with time, its elements return to their primary state. This means that  certain materials, mainly soil, are not lost to the community but remain as  part of its common wealth. However recent efforts to produce cheaper and more  permanent rural housing by the introduction of a soil stabilising technology  could easily interfere with this natural process, and its indiscriminate use  could also bring about the creation of large quantities of equally permanent  rubble.</p>
        <h5>THE  ECOLOGY OF THE SETTLEMENT</h5>
        <p>The ecological balance achieved between the larger settlement of  rural man and nature is somewhat more complex, being influenced by such factors  as social custom, land ownership rights and traditional agrarian practices. For  the purposes of this article it is proposed to give only a brief resume of the  issues involved.</p>
        <p>In the past, when the rural dweller considered the site for his  new homestead, his choice was influenced by a number of factors. Primarily  these had to do with the availability of resources such as potable water and  building materials but other elements such as ground slope, drainage,  orientation and aspect were also important. Historically too, elevation and  defense were also considered, but these have tended to be ignored in more  recent times.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most critical of all these factors, however, was the  availability of agricultural land in the immediate vicinity of the settlement.  The rural homestead was part of a self-sustaining economy which relied upon the  fruits of the soil as the major source for its food. Although farmers were also  pastoralists, cattle were regarded primarily as a source of wealth to be used  for the purpose of obtaining brides for the family unit. The usufruct of cattle  was limited to the provision of milk on a daily basis, but even so cattle were  not bred for their milk-producing capacity. In fact very little deliberate  cattle breeding appears to have occurred. When the slaughter of an animal did  take place, this was usually for ritual purposes, and then the whole community  took part in the meal and no attempt was made at storage of the meat.</p>
        <p>Traditional agricultural activity could be said to have been  distributed across four major fields:</p>
        <ol type="a">
          <li>Grazing  land which fell into two areas of seasonal activity: summer and winter grazing.  The former was usually close at hand to the settlement whilst the latter could  have been at a distance of several days or even weeks of travel from it. This  gave summer grazing the opportunity of recovering for the new season.</li>
          <li>Sandy soil planting land.</li>
          <li>Loam  soil planting land.</li>
          <li>Clay  soil planting land.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Families were usually allocated planting lands in all three soil  zones. This meant that not only was it possible to plant a variety of crops,  some vegetables being more suitable to one kind of soil than others, but this  acted as a form of insurance against the vagaries of the weather. Generally  loam soils were considered to give a good crop in an average year; sandy soil  crops prospered in wet seasons when the over-wet clay would have allowed the  seed to rot; and clay soil crops fared well in the drier years when the clay  retained moisture better than the well-drained soils. A family's planting lands  could be anything up to 40km from each other, which meant that during the  harvest, temporary villages would grow up alongside their fields.</p>
        <p>However, since 1913 and the first of the Land Acts which  established the so-called &quot;Native Reserves&quot;, the whole pattern  of rural agriculture has changed radically. Lack of suitable pastorage has  increased rural poverty whilst the rising population within the confines of the  relatively small rural areas set aside for black occupation has led to the  impoverishment of planting land and the loss of large tracts of former fertile  fields. Also, the availability of a transport infrastructure gave competing  white farmers an unfair advantage in getting their produce to markets and many  black peasant farmers could not remain economically viable under these  circumstances. Thus any discussion on the links between human settlement and  agricultural land should be read in a historical context and not as a  reflection of current conditions.</p>
        <p>In the process a new factor has emerged in the question of rural  settlement: that of rural overpopulation. Pictorial records of the Zululand countryside just over a century ago show a  landscape littered with small homesteads. Their location however, far from  being haphazard, appears to be subject to some form of rule-of-thumb  distancing. Aerial photographs of the remains of eighteenth century settlement  areas on the Transvaal and OFS highveld also  show a similar grouping of family units. Both would appear to indicate the  existence of what Robert Ardrey has called a &quot;territorial imperative&quot;  in human settlement. The establishment of such an imperative is conditioned by  the natural resources which a settlement needs to control in order to survive  as a rural production unit. This means that the amount of land required cannot  be easily quantified and may change from region to region and from economy to  economy. It may also vary in the history of a settlement as the size of its  population fluctuates and grows.</p>
        <p>A rural production unit also tends to generate a certain amount of  wastes, partly natural, partly manufactured, which are absorbed and processed  by nature. Those discarded on the midden, for example, are incorporated into  the rural cycle of life where some farm animals contribute to the removal of  food scraps and others, like cattle and donkeys, roll in the spent hearth ashes  as a means of controlling ticks. Human wastes, on the other hand, are scattered  further afield to decompose organically and become absorbed into the soil.</p>
        <p>In more recent times we have seen the rise in southern Africa of  large scale rural, semi-urban settlements in such places as Acornhoek,  Bushbuckridge, Melelane, Thaba 'Nchu, Winterveld and Dennilton to name but a  few. These towns are endowed with few social amenities and virtually no  supporting physical infrastructure. In such areas many of the traditional  concepts of &quot;homestead&quot; have fallen by the wayside and the control of  land for agricultural purposes has been overtaken by a need for residential  space. Also the competition for building resources has forced rural builders  into using modified rural technologies in order to provide themselves with  housing of an acceptable standard. Despite the lack of fresh water and waste  removal facilities they have generally met with a remarkably high degree of  success. However in some areas population densities have reached such  concentrations that natural processes have been unable to keep up with the  inflow of waste materials. This has often resulted in the pollution of water  resources. The outbreaks of cholera experienced in the central and western Transvaal during the summer of 1981-1982 must be  attributed directly to the overburdening of rural land by human settlements  living in near-urban densities but under rural conditions.</p>
        <h5>CONCLUSIONS</h5>
        <p>In spite of the fact that South Africa has now accepted that significant  economic and political changes will have to be wrought in our society in order  to meet the aspirations of all our citizens, to date most action has focused  upon the urban areas. As a result there has been a tendency to overlook  important developments taking place in our rural areas. This is shortsighted,  not only because 50% of our national population resides in the country, but  also because the quality of life in rural areas is subject to delicate balances  which, if broken, may not be rectified by an expensive extension of urban  infrastructures. As a result many a rural resident, faced with the prospect of  hardship, has opted for a life in the city where, at least, he may enjoy higher  standards of living. Thus a breakdown in rural conditions may be seen as a  major contributory factor to the problems of growing urbanisation. If these are  to be tackled at root source then the resolution of rural difficulties must  stand high on our agenda of national priorities.</p>
