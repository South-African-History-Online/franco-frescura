        <h5>THE  PRE-INDUSTRIAL ARCHITECTURE OF THE EASTERN    CAPE<br />
          A Historical Survey</h5>
        <p>Franco Frescura</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>&quot;<em>Port Elizabeth ... is much like a small,  English sea-port town, and contains about 100 houses, exclusive of huts; ...  The town is said to have been chiefly raised by the sale of strong drink.</em>&quot; James Backhouse, December 1838.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h5>INTRODUCTION</h5>
        <p>Few regions of southern Africa can equal the eastern Cape's cultural heritage for either  its richness or diversity. Over the past five hundred years numerous indigenous  and immigrant groups have made this area their home, bringing with them a  variety of cultures and economic activities. Although many of them have since  passed on into local folklore or were simply absorbed by other groups, all have  left their mark etched indelibly in the social and historical fabric of local  society.</p>
        <p>Originally Khoikhoi migrant pastoralists intermingled with San  hunter gatherers and Xhosa pastoralist farmers. However, by the time the first  white settlers reached this region during the mid-eighteenth century, we find  that extensive intermarriage had taken place between these groups and that, in  many cases, they had begun to adopt aspects of each other's economic  activities. Thus Khoikhoi farmers could be found alongside lands used by San  migrant pastoralists whilst the Xhosa used the territory as far south as Plettenberg Bay for their cattle winter grazing.</p>
        <p>The first whites to settle in this region arrived here by accident  and misadventure rather than by design, being the survivors of shipwrecks which  occurred on the eastern seaboard with almost predictable regularity from 1552  onwards. Many seamen, Portuguese, Dutch and English, found their way here thus  and although some perished in attempts to return to their land, a considerable  number remained behind, were adopted by indigenous groups, took local wives,  fathered numerous children and generally prospered. A group of settlers who  were similarly marooned on these shores but whom history has generally tended  to ignore were the slaves brought over as cargo on these ships. They originated  from parts of Malaya, India,  China and central Africa and were often the first to find shelter among  local tribes, a life of freedom in a foreign land being immeasurably preferable  to a return to bondage.</p>
        <p>During the latter half of the eighteenth century the Dutch  settlement of the Cape spread eastwards, in the process making increasing  inroads into the indigenous pastoral lands of the eastern Cape. Not unnaturally, their owners  resented this and increasingly resisted such encroachment. As a result the  first of a long series of periodic border clashes took place in 1779. The  position was aggravated after 1820 with the arrival in the eastern   Cape of successive waves of settlers originating from Britain and Germany whose intention was to  bring stability to the region but whose presence ultimately made it necessary  to garrison it on a permanent basis.</p>
        <p>A final component vital to the cultural mix of the eastern Cape was the  Christian missionaries who arrived here from 1803 onwards. They must have  discovered the region to be singularly godless for, over the next century, they  established close on two hundred stations in this area alone. Although their  activities were intended to be primarily spiritual, they nonetheless prepared  the way for the arrival of traders and, subsequently, government agents, both  of who were to have profound long-term influences upon local culture (Frescura,  1985).</p>
        <h5>PHYSICAL  ENVIRONMENT</h5>
        <p>Although the architecture of the eastern Cape may be considered to be a  direct reflection of the cultural patterns of its inhabitants, their buildings  have also responded to their physical surrounds. Few parts of the region have  ever encouraged permanent human settlement, being generally given to prolonged  droughts, periodic flash floods, seasonal high winds and spreading  desertification. The Rev Vanderkemp who founded the missionary village of Bethelsdorp in 1803 came under severe  criticism from his colleagues for not encouraging greater industry and  agriculture in the settlement. Yet when it was visited by Campbell in 1813 this gentleman found that  the ground was rocky, the water brackish, the population transient and  conventional agriculture almost impossible. He concluded that:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>&quot;...<em> it has a most miserable  appearance as a village. The houses are mean, ... The ground on which it stands  is barren in the extreme, so that nothing green is to be seen near the houses  ... all this arises from the total want of good water ... In consequence of the  miserable appearance of the village, the settlers are by many people reported  to be extremely indolent.</em>&quot; (Campbell,  1815)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>In spite of this the settlements of man not only managed to  survive but, in many cases, also flourished. The resultant architecture was  invariably functional, seldom picturesque, and always endowed with a regional  flavour distinct to the eastern Cape.  More specifically the eastern Cape  may be said to fall into three major climatic areas:</p>
        <ol type="a">
          <li type="a">The  equable, sub-tropical coastal region running in a narrow belt from Plettenberg Bay  in the south through into the Transkei  and Natal. This  is a predominantly winter rainfall area characterised by large tracts of  indigenous forest interspersed with savannah grasses.</li>
          <li type="a">The  eastern plateau slopes running in a broad belt from the Burghersdorp-Cathcart  region northwards into the Transkei.  It is characterised by year-round rainfalls but is also liable to very low  temperatures and severe frosts in the winter. Vegetation is a rich grassveld  which tends to become sparse and is replaced with encroaching Karoo  shrub as aridity increases towards the south.</li>
          <li type="a">The  semi-arid plateau region running in a broad belt from Queenstown in the east  through to Willowmore in the west and from the sub-tropical coastal region to  the south northward into the western Orange Free State  and northern Cape.  It is characterised by low and unreliable rainfalls and great seasonal extremes  of temperature. Vegetation is predominantly a Karoo  or desert scrub with scant grass cover (Cole, 1961).</li>
        </ol>
        <h5>SOURCES  OF INFORMATION</h5>
        <p>It is not easy to piece together a general picture of the  architecture of the eastern Cape  before the Difaqane. Because of the nature of the structures concerned, very  little direct knowledge of indigenous architectural forms and building  technologies has come down to the present day and much of what we do know is  the direct result of archaeological research and interpretation. Unlike the  historian, the architect is unable to draw upon the richness of local oral  traditions to any great extent and thus much of the data at hand is open to  many interpretations, some of these being conflicting. The major sources of  early information available to us may be summed up as follows:</p>
        <ol type="a">
          <li type="a">Archaeological  reconstruction. Regrettably the amount of archaeological data available for  this region is negligible.</li>
          <li type="a">The  accounts of shipwreck survivors on the south-eastern African coastline.</li>
          <li type="a">The  accounts of travellers into the region, which began to find publication in Europe during the first part of the eighteenth century  and were to continue until the 1880s.</li>
          <li type="a">Field  research into current building technologies and dwelling forms.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Ideally, the piecing together of a historical picture such as this  should draw equally upon all three research components, archaeological,  historical and current, in order to achieve greatest accuracy.</p>
        <p>After the 1820's the nature of data available to the architectural  historian changes perceptibly. Archaeological sources play a decreasing role  whilst greater reliance is made upon the writings of explorers, missionaries  and settlers. The first was a small but distinguished group, often being men of  letters and of means who came in the quest of knowledge, driven by a curiosity  for new discoveries. Although their work of exploration overlapped and  eventually merged with that of the missionaries, unlike them they came, saw,  wrote, sketched and then returned to Europe.  Missionary workers however came with the intent of establishing a permanent  proselytizing presence in the region and what began as a small trickle at the  turn of the last century became a veritable flood by the 1840s. Both these  groups, explorers and missionaries alike, were generally well educated and  highly eloquent, a fact testified to by the plethora of travel accounts and  holy tomes which was subsequently to issue from their pens. It is largely to  them that we owe our present knowledge of the architecture of the region at  this time.</p>
        <p>The third group, the settlers, was more concerned with the  practical issues of survival in a land which was perceived to be alien and  antagonistic to whites. Thus, although many of them were literate and some made  small references in their journals to the architecture of the eastern Cape, their data usually only served  to confirm what was already being published by other writers.</p>
        <h5>ESTABLISHING  A GENERAL FRAMEWORK</h5>
        <p>Although a wide range of dwelling forms is known to have been  built in southern Africa since prehistoric times, the pre- industrial  architecture of the eastern Cape  was dominated by two major dwelling types. Essentially similar in form, they  nonetheless represent radically differing economic and cultural systems and, as  such, were identified with diverse geographical regions.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>The  mat beehive dwelling was identified with the migrant pastoralist Khoikhoi and  was built in an area which originally encompassed the major part of the Cape and southern OFS. By the early 1800s the rapid  expansion of white settlement from the south had reduced it into three small  enclaves: the north-western Cape or Namaqualand, the north-central Cape, and  the Eastern Province. By 1925 only the architectural  traditions of Namaqualand had survived, albeit  in a much altered form.</li>
          <li>The  grass beehive dwelling was identified with Xhosa pastoralist farmers who  originally inhabited the eastern Cape's  coastal belt. This area has undergone a steady reduction in size since the end  of the nineteenth century when the growth of major population centers began to  place increasing stress upon the rural environment, its economy and traditional  social structures. As a result beehive structures began to be replaced by a  cone on cylinder technology from the 1880s onwards and today only survive as  initiation huts in parts of the southern Transkei.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>It must also be borne in mind that hunter-gatherer San are also  known to have inhabited the interior of the eastern Cape and are recorded, at times, to  have employed mat dwellings very similar in nature to the Khoikhoi.  Regrettably, because of the nature of their activities, relatively little is  known of their architecture beyond a meagre stock of reports by nineteenth  century travellers made at a time when the San were on the point of extinction  in this region.</p>
        <p>It will be seen therefore that the eastern Cape represents an area of cultural  and economic overlap between Khoikhoi pastoralists and Xhosa farmers. Although  their respective beehive building techniques appear outwardly to have been  homogeneous, it is probable that a variety of technologies existed  contemporarily in this region. Regrettably, because of the changing nature of  its economic activity, neither beehive tradition survived the combined  cultural, religious, military and material onslaught of immigrant whites.</p>
        <h5>THE  MIGRANT PASTORALIST BEEHIVE REGION</h5>
        <p>This area originally encompassed the major part of present-day Cape  Province up to southern Namibia, the northern central Cape, the southern Orange  Free State highveld and the eastern Cape, although it is possible that migrant  pastoralist farmers from this region may, at one time, have extended their  activities up to the KiGariep or Vaal River.</p>
        <p>As its name suggests, this is an area where beehive structures  were built extensively and, at one time, were probably its predominant domestic  form. However, an important component of the architectural make-up of this  region is the economic system practiced by its inhabitants before 1800. Thus we  find that although a small number of different dwelling types are known to have  existed here, they all have in common the fact that they were either  impermanent or transportable, a factor of migrant pastoralist society.  Travellers commonly associated the mat beehive form with the migrant  pastoralist Khoikhoi whilst the mat shelter was attributed to the  hunter-gatherer San.</p>
        <p>The  indigenous dwellings of the region may be described under the following  headings:</p>
        <ol start="1" type="a">
          <li type="a" value="1"><strong>Temporary  or primitive shelter</strong>.  This could take the form of an unmodified cave or rock overhang, or a series of  bushes in their natural state, their boughs bent inward and tied at a common  apex, described by Lichtenstein as &quot;<em>an immense bird's nest</em>.&quot;  (1812 and 1815)</li>
        </ol>
        <ol start="1" type="a">
          <li type="a" value="2"><strong>Transportable  matting shelter</strong>.  This was described by Barrow in c1797 as:
            <blockquote>
              <p>&quot;...<em> a small grass-mat bent into a  semicircle, and fastened down between two sticks; open before, but closed  behind with a second mat. They were about three feet high and four feet wide  and the ground in the middle was dug out like the nest of an ostrich ... One of  these miserable huts served for a whole family.</em>&quot; (1801 and 1804)</p>
            </blockquote>
          The painting by Daniell of a similar  structure in c1804 (1820) shows that the second mat Barrow refers to did not so  much close the tunnel as create a wind shelter at the back for the residents.  The work of other authors reveals that both the vaulted mat and the rear  wind-break could be used independently of the other. The whole structure could  be disassembled and taken to the site of the group's next settlement. Although  the San are normally associated with this type of shelter, the Khoikhoi are  also known to have built similar if not identical structures.  </li>
        </ol>
        <ol start="3" type="a">
          <li type="a" value="3"><strong>Transportable  beehive dwellings</strong>.  A sapling structure was planted into the ground in a circle or oval of 3 to 4m  in diameter and covered over with reed matting tied down with grass ropes.  Animal skins could also be used instead of mats, but these were normally  reserved for the lower skirt of the hut where this more flexible material was  better able to seal off the hard edge with the ground. The doorway could be  repositioned by the simple expedient of redistributing the matting. The height  of the average beehive dome does not seem to have exceeded 1.2 to 1.5m, but, in  some cases, the interior head-height was improved by partly excavating the hut  floor. However it appears that the dwelling of a headman or chief was built to  more generous dimensions. Campbell recorded in  1813 that Cornelius Kok's dwellings at Silverfontein, in Namaqualand,  were &quot;<em>much larger, so that a person can walk about them.</em>&quot;  (1815)          <br />
            <br />
          However not all Khoi residences may have  been circular in plan. As early as 1775 Sparrman originated the idea that some  may have been oblong (1975) or oval.<br />
          <br />
          Judging from a description given by Campbell (1815) in 1813,  it appears that under certain circumstances, some parts of the beehive mat  structure may have been used to provide the equivalent of a dismountable  matting shelter. It would seem therefore that these two types of dwelling may  have been interchangeable or even designed to be part of one and the same  system.<br />
          <br />
          The earliest records of beehive mat  dwellings may be found in the accounts of survivors of the Santo Alberto, a Portuguese  slaver which was wrecked on the east coast of southern African somewhere  between Algoa Bay  and the Buffalo River in 1593. Soon after the survivors  began their journey north they encountered a group of agrarian pastoralists who  may have been Xhosa but whose residences were round and low and covered with  reed mats which were not proof against the rain, a description which matches  that of the architecture of the Khoikhoi (Theal, 1927). Although this may well  be viewed as the documentation of an early case of Xhosa-Khoi cross-cultural  pollination, it is far more likely to illustrate the large degree of overlap  and even interchangeability which is thought to have existed between the  migrant pastoralist and agrarian pastoralist economies of that region.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol start="3" type="a">
          <li type="a" value="4"><strong>The  Cottage Dwelling</strong>. This  is a domestic form which originated in the European &quot;long house&quot;  tradition and came to be associated with white farmer and missionary settlement  from the seventeenth through to the early part of the twentieth centuries. As  such then it is also closely related to the development of a Cape Dutch  architectural tradition. Although there are a number of documented cases where  the indigenous construction of cottage dwellings took place from as early as  1775, it was found that this usually occurred at the instigation or under the  guidance of missionaries. The structure was usually based upon a rectangular  plan, having one or two rooms, and the roof was either hipped or gable ended.  Entrance was gained through the long or eaves end of the building.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol start="3" type="a">
          <li type="a" value="5"><strong>The  Flat Roofed Parapet Dwelling</strong>. This is a residential form whose plan is based upon the Cape Cottage  or &quot;<em>long house</em>&quot; tradition described above. Its origins may be  traced back to Cape Town  as early as 1717 although, during the next two hundred years, it also become  associated with a number of different urban as well as rural environments  further inland. However its spread into the local vernacular does not appear to  have taken place until somewhat later. Sparrman, who in 1775 visited a Khoi settlement  in the Outeniquas, noted that, apart from the usual beehive dwellings  associated with this group, others structures &quot;<em> were built of straw in  square form, with shelving roofs, like the cottages of the slaves.</em>&quot;  (1975)<br />
            <br />
          This is probably one of the earliest  references to the use of a flat roofed cottage by Khoikhoi farmers although  reports of such dwellings in an indigenous context only become more common  after 1800. Most coincide with the establishment of mission stations such as  Genadendal, Bethelsdorp, Sak River, Pella,  Hardcastle and Griquatown. It becomes obvious therefore that the question of  dwelling form at this time also becomes interlinked with issues of religious  proselytizing, technological expertise and security of land tenure and must be  considered in social and economic as well as cultural and aesthetic terms.<br />
          <br />
          Although this dwelling form is largely  associated with the interior of southern Africa, a few examples are also known  to have been built in the eastern    Cape, mostly in the larger urban areas. Its spread  during the latter half of the nineteenth century was facilitated to a large  extent by the introduction, in the early 1860s, of corrugated iron sheeting  imported from Britain.  The adoption of corrugated iron into black rural architecture was not  immediate. Very little of it is evident in the photography of Duggan-Cronin in  the 1920s and the 1930s and it only emerges as a force in indigenous building  from about the 1940s onwards.<br />
          <br />
          Mention should also be made of the fact  that, since the early 1970s, the flat-roofed dwelling has become associated  with the emergence of squatter settlements about southern Africa's  major urban and industrial areas. The basic lean-to shelter is quick and  economical to erect and its modular nature lends itself to the core-house  principle.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol start="3" type="a">
          <li type="a" value="6"><strong>The  Kapsteilhuis and the Hardbieshuis</strong>. The exact origins of the kapsteilhuis  and the somewhat similar hardbieshuis are not known, but records have  shown that their construction was known in the vicinity of Cape   Town as early as the 1680s (Cape Archives).  This would seem to confirm their immigrant, and probably Dutch, roots. They  appears to have been popular among farmers during the early years of European  settlement at the Cape, probably serving as  temporary dwellings or produce sheds. By the 1840s their use had spread to the  Khoi on Cape mission stations as well as  missionaries and settlers further inland. Backhouse noted in 1839 that, in at  least one instance at Groenekloof, the kapsteilhuis appeared to be  serving an interim or transitionary function amongst Khoikhoi families who were  in the process of evolving from traditional mat beehive structures to a more  conventional cottage aesthetic (Backhouse, 1844).<br />
            <br />
            The use of this structure however was not  limited to the Dutch or the Khoi. Lewcock states that the English settlers of  the 1820s employed it as an interim shelter in the eastern Cape (1963), while  Lord and Baines in 1876 wrote that &quot;<em>The hartebeeste hut ... mostly used  by colonial&nbsp; (Khoikhoi), is simple and  easy enough to make.&nbsp; It has one straight  side, and one lean-to ...</em>&quot; (1876)<br />
            <br />
          The interrelationship existing between the  indigenous Khoikhoi and immigrant Dutch farmers is well illustrated by the fact  that the hardbieshuis was also to become identified with the trekboer  movement into the OFS and Natal from the 1840s  onwards, whilst at the same time becoming integrated into the Cape  stereotype of Griqua and Koranna architecture. They continued to be built by  Griqua farmers well into the 1870s and, in some isolated instances, possibly  even later.<br />
          <br />
          </li>
          <li type="a" value="7"><strong>Various  other structures</strong>  of a domestic nature are also known to have been built in the region during  this time. De Beaulieu recorded in 1620 that some of the indigenous inhabitants  of Table Bay &quot;<em>had no shelter other  than bushes and some skins stretched on two crossed sticks, with another in the  middle to thrust in to the ground like a parasol, ...</em>&quot; (Raven-Hart,  1957)<br />
            <br />
            In 1775 Sparrman visited the homestead of  the Khoi headman Rundganger in the Riet   Valley whose dwelling was  built &quot;<em>so that altogether it had the shape of a cone</em>.&quot; (1975).<br />
            <br />
          The structure was &quot;<em>three or four  times larger than common</em>&quot;, and in view of the fact that Rundganger is  known to have visited the southern African interior on numerous occasions  previously, it is probable this construction was inspired by the cone on  cylinder residences he must have observed inland.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Before 1820 the architectural picture of this region is therefore  not a difficult one to describe, with the Khoikhoi beehive being almost  universally built throughout from the 1550s through to the end of the  eighteenth century. Although this dwelling form was to remain dominant here for  yet another generation or two, by the end of that period the process of  alienation of the Khoikhoi from their traditional grazing lands, their means of  subsistence and hence also their architecture, was well advanced.</p>
        <p>By the beginning of the Difaqane in 1822 the last of the migrant  pastoralists had been driven to arid and more uninhabitable fringes of the  region. Those Khoi who remained within the boundaries of the Cape  no longer built beehive structures as of old but in many cases followed the  example of local farmers and of missionaries and built kapsteilhuise, hardbieshuise  and square plan cottages as part of an established economic cycle. Such  examples were recorded at Groene Kloof (Mamre), Wupperthal, Zuurbraak, Shiloh,  the Kat River settlement area and Griquatown to name but a few. It is also  worthwhile to note that all of the above locations were also mission stations.  The correlation in this case between dwelling form and missionary activity is  therefore unmistakable.</p>
        <p>Although the mat-covered beehive was, by now, firmly established  in the public mind as a Khoikhoi architectural stereotype, these were now built  mostly on the fringes of the Cape Colony, including Philippi and Shiloh in the eastern Cape.</p>
        <p>Little is known of the San and their movements in the eastern Cape during this  time and thus their matting shelters fade forever from the architectural  picture of this area.</p>
        <p>After the 1820s the historical architecture of this region  virtually disappears. Scattered examples of mat structures or maantje huise,  as they were now called, were still being built, but not as frequently as  before. In the eastern Cape, Baines reported  that some could be found at Seymour in 1848  (1961 and 1964) whilst Dower stated that Griqua immigrants into the Mount Currie  area were using them there as late as 1869 (1902).</p>
        <p>Hardbieshuise  and kapsteilhuise were both being built by some Khoi during this period  and Baines recorded a number at Shiloh mission  station in 1848 (1961 and 1964). It is not known exactly when these dwelling  forms began to be regarded as archaic and ceased to be built by the indigenous  inhabitants of this region, but their mention in the accounts of travelers  ceases soon thereafter.</p>
        <h5>THE  EASTERN LITTORAL BEEHIVE REGION</h5>
        <p>This region is fairly widespread, running the full length of the  southern African eastern littoral from Swaziland  in the north to the Great Fish River  in the south, although it is possible that it once may have stretched as far as  Algoa Bay.</p>
        <p>Although up to comparatively recent times the architecture of this  region was overwhelmingly orientated towards the grass-thatched hemispherical  dome, its technology was by no means homogeneous. Indeed, a number of  interesting variants on the theme of the basic dwelling are thought to have  developed. Unfortunately a scarcity of historical data makes it difficult to  determine with any certainty whether these were examples of a typical regional  stereotype, whether they were associated with some kind of group identity or  whether they were unique unto themselves. It is however important to  differentiate between the grass-covered hemispherical domes of this region and  the mat-covered types found further south and west. The latter were temporary  shelters, easily dismountable and transportable, more in the nature of tents  than dwellings, and developed to meet the needs of a migrant society pursuing a  pastoralist economy. The former were permanent and of substantial construction,  designed to last for a number of years and although theoretically portable,  seldom moved over any considerable distances. The people who built them were  agrarian pastoralists with strong ties to their planting lands and although the  removal of a household from one location to the next was by no means unknown,  their settlements were of a generally more permanent nature. The implications  of this are most important from a historical point of view: migrant settlement,  by its very nature, has tended to leave behind few interpretable traces of its  architecture; early agrarian settlement on the other hand tends to etch its  presence somewhat more markedly upon the land it covers, although even such  evidence is often too scanty to be conclusive.</p>
        <p>The earliest evidence of hemispherical dome building found to date  on the eastern littoral was documented by Maggs in the Tukela basin in Zululand (1980) where dwellings are thought to have  consisted of a framework of saplings partly plastered over with clay. A  carbon-dating analysis of their remains has set their date at about 600 AD.  Further south however, the earliest domestic structures recorded were those  reported by the survivors of the Santo Bento, shipwrecked in 1554 near the mouth  of the Mtamvuma River, and by those of the Santo Joao Baptista, shipwrecked in  1622, who encountered what must have been Nguni settlements on the banks of the  Bashee River (Theal, 1927).</p>
        <p>Thereafter accounts of hemispherical dome dwellings in the eastern  Cape become more common, reports being made by Le Vaillant in 1781 (1790), by  Holtshausen's party searching for survivors of the Grosvenor in 1790 (Theal,  1927), by Barrow in 1797 (1801 and 1804) and by Campbell in 1813 (1815). These  are generally assumed to have been thatched in a more conventional grass  technology but other building methods are also thought to have been in use at  that time. Alberti writing in 1803 described the construction of a Xhosa hut as  follows:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>&quot;...<em>, thin poles of a pliable wood are  stuck in the ground along the planned circumference at a distance of sixteen  inches (400mm) from one another.&nbsp; These  are bent together and joined in the middle to form a framework, which is then  covered with reed, and finally faced with a mixture of clay and cowdung on both  the inside and outside.</em>&quot;</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>He  further tells us that:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>&quot;<em>In the area which is further removed  from the borders of the Colony, and where the tribes less often leave or change  their abodes, these habitations are usually double in such a way that two huts  stand opposite each other and enclose an intermediate space, apart from the  inner chamber, which then serves as a sleeping place for the children as well  as a storage place for many other requirements.</em>&quot; (Alberti, 1968)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This account was confirmed by Lichtenstein who traveled through  this part of the country in the same party as Alberti in 1803. He also stated  that &quot;<em>The spaces between the poles are filled up with twigs, or rather  faggots and then the whole is covered over to a certain height with a mixture  of clay and cow-dung, the remainder being thatched with rushes.</em>&quot; (1812  and 1815)</p>
        <p>Judging from their respective accounts, both men were quite  obviously describing the same kind of building technology, yet the resultant  forms are quite different. Alberti's would have presented a smooth  hemispherical shape which, although feasible, would not have been too practical  in terms of rainwater exclusion and internal smoke ventilation. Despite their  probable structural shortcomings however, such dwellings must have quite  obviously existed in this region at that time. Alberti's description was  supported by the accounts of both Von Winkelman in 1788 and Phillips in 1825,  the latter claiming that the Thembu covered their huts with &quot;<em>mud and  manure</em>&quot; in order to prevent their cattle from consuming the thatch. On  the other hand, other authors writing in the same period, such as Vanderkemp in  1800 and Smith in 1824, are in agreement that it was only the inside surface of  the dome which was coated with daka, the outside being thatched with  grass.</p>
        <p>Lichtenstein, in his turn, described a dwelling whose structure  was substantially the same as those presented above but whose final form would  have been somewhat different, possibly something like a squat mushroom. This was  confirmed by Bonatz, who, writing in 1834, provided a description of Thembu and  Mbo dwellings of a similar nature. After the 1850s, pictorial evidence of such  dwellings becomes more readily available and continues through and well into  this century.</p>
        <p>During the Difaqane the architecture of this region becomes  particularly difficult to assess. Not only was this a time which saw the large  scale migration of populations, but their resettlement brought about extensive  changes to the cultural map of southern Africa. Although the eastern Cape was not affected directly by  invasions from the north, the Difaqane was responsible for the introduction of  both Thembu and Mfengu refugees in the region. Also, increasing white  settlement and an ensuing series of border clashes had the effect of forcing  the Xhosa off what were essentially their winter grazing lands and pushing them  back over the Great   Fish River.  Scattered hemispherical dome construction appears to have continued in this  area, particularly in the vicinity of mission stations and newly established  centres of urban growth.</p>
        <p>The period immediately after the Difaqane was marked by a large  influx of both missionaries and travellers into the eastern littoral beehive  region. During the course of their journeys these men, and sometimes women,  were able to document local architecture in some detail.</p>
        <p>They found that the patterns of change established by the Difaqane  continued at an increasing rate as, on the one hand, the region settled down to  its new population distributions and tribal mix, and, on the other, contact  with missionaries and other white settlers became more commonplace. The picture  was also simplified to some degree by the disappearance of the migrant  pastoralist mat dome tradition.</p>
        <p>Although the eastern    Cape as a whole was to remain the undisputed preserve  of the beehive dwelling form up to the turn of the century, areas of change  were already becoming evident in the 1840s and possibly even earlier.  Ultimately, over the next four generations, the whole face of the built  environment underwent a total transformation as the hemispherical dome gave way  to the cone on cylinder.</p>
        <p>It is difficult to determine today exactly what the mechanics of  such change could have been. Certainly there is some evidence to show that the  cone on cylinder was being used by both missionaries and military personnel in  this region long before it was to become widely associated with local  indigenous architecture. It is possible that missionaries at the Blinkwater  station had built such dwellings as early as 1839 (Backhouse, 1844); and the  military establishment at Umtata  in c1862 had included one within its fortified earthworks whilst an entire  village of them could be found outside it (Anonymous, 1932), but this in itself  is not conclusive evidence. We also know that both the military and  missionaries had a habit of borrowing existing indigenous forms and  technologies to suit their own short-term needs, and it is therefore not  impossible that this was precisely the case in the examples given above. When  Baines visited Butterworth in 1851 he recorded that it consisted:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>&quot;<em>..., besides the chapel and mission  premises, of three or four thatched houses, a considerable number of huts - and  rondheuvels, a kind of dwelling scarcely superior - and an immense kraal  ..</em>.&quot; (1961  and 1964)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>It is therefore probable from this description that the cone on  cylinder (or rondawel) form was by that time already an integral part of  the local vocabulary of architecture.</p>
        <p>The claim that the cone on cylinder is the indigenous product of  this region is further supported by other sources. The hut form described by  Lichtenstein in the southern Transkei  in 1805, discussed earlier, could best be described as a dome raised on a drum  or a cylinder (1812 and 1815). According to him, this type of dwelling was  widespread further north, but this claim was not substantiated in other records  until after the 1860s. These included reports from Wartburg in 1867, Ibeka Fort  c1877, Gonubie in 1878 and King William's Town in 1876. Thereafter its presence  is supported by abundant documentation until the 1940s when its construction  becomes less common.</p>
        <p>The 1840 to 1925 era can therefore be seen to represent a period  of decline and, ultimately, extinction for hemispherical grass dome dwellings.  While their presence was reported on a regular basis by travellers from 1840 to  1860, by the 1880s very few of these structures appear to have been built. By  the time Duggan-Cronin visited these districts in the late 1920s the &quot;<em>pure</em>&quot;  beehive form had quite clearly been relegated, in local thinking, to the realms  of the archaic and its construction associated with the practice of initiation  rites (1939, 1949 and 1954). On the other hand the building of cone on cylinder  structures appears to have begun at about the turn of the century and to have  been well established by 1925. From the 1940s onwards those districts which, a  century earlier, had been a stronghold of hemispherical grass dome technology,  had crossed over to the cone on cylinder dwelling, a tradition which has been  sustained through to the present day.</p>
        <h5>CONCLUSIONS</h5>
        <p>Although the eastern    Cape could have laid claim to a degree of cultural  homogeneity during the early part of the nineteenth century, the pastoral  nature of Khoi society and the fragmented political system of Xhosa-speakers  effectively encouraged the large scale infiltration of this area by white  settlers, missionaries and traders. These groups shared in the mutual objective  of bringing about radical changes in indigenous economic patterns and, at least  in the case of missionaries, made a point of encouraging alterations in local  architectural styles. Although their degree of success in this self-appointed  task is debatable, there is no doubt that their presence, the imposition of a  hut tax, and the spread of urbanisation in later years were all to wreak havoc  in the people's traditional value systems, thereby paving the way for  subsequent changes in local architectural practices.</p>
        <p>This work was strengthened by a growing availability of modern  roofing materials, such as corrugated iron sheeting, and the spread, through  the agency of missionary trade schools, immigrant farmers and a growing migrant  labour system, of new roof and wall building technologies. The resultant mix of  traditional and immigrant building techniques enriched the architectural  tradition of the eastern Cape  and gave its vocabulary greater depth and variety of expression.</p>
