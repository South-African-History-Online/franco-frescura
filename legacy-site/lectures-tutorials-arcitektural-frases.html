	    <li>The  Renaissance was a Bourgioesie movement.</li>
	    <li>Reniassance  is a word meaning rebirth.</li>
	    <li>The  Renaissance in Italy  was mainly because of people looking for their identity.</li>
	    <li>The  Renaissance was noted for its Humanic Philosophy.</li>
	    <li>An  enthusiasm spread throughout Europe.</li>

	    <li>The  first half of the 16th century quickens in tempo ... as the people  of that time start to get restless and move to a new revolution.</li>

	    <li>Things  were not as previous where it all went to the church or some gready Pope.</li>

	  <h5>AND  FINALLY, WHAT YOUR LECTURERS REALLY MEAN WHEN THEY SAY &hellip;</h5>
	  <p><em>&quot;It is believed  that ...&quot;</em> I think  so<br />
        <em>&quot;It is generally  believed that ..</em>.&quot; A  couple of other guys think so too<br />
  &quot;<em>It is clear  that much additional work will be required before a complete understanding is  attained.</em>&quot; I  do not understand it<br />
  <em>&quot;Correct within  an order of magnitude</em>.&quot; Wrong<br />
  &quot;<em>It has long  been known ...</em>&quot; I  have not bothered to look up the original reference<br />
  &quot;<em>Of great  theoretical and practical importance</em>&quot;: It is interesting to me<br />
  &quot;<em>Three of the  samples were chosen for detailed study</em>&quot;: The others did not make sense and were therefore left out<br />
  &quot;<em>Thanks are due  to Joe Bloggs for assisting with the project, and to John Burger for valuable  discussions</em>&quot;:  Bloggs did the work, and Burger explained to me what it meant<br />
  &quot;<em>It is hoped  that this study will stimulate further work in the field</em>&quot;: This paper is not very good, but then  neither are any of the others on the subject<br />
  &quot;<em>The primary aim  of this project is ...</em>&quot; It wasn't originally, but these are our best results<br />
  &quot;<em>This book is  dedicated to my parents</em>&quot;: They paid for it<br />
  &quot;<em>Without their  help this work would have suffered from a substantial reduction in its data  base</em>&quot;: They  did all the research<br />
  &quot;<em>This project  has had a long and chequered career</em>&quot;: My co-author ran off with my wife and my kids won&rsquo;t return any of  my calls.<br />
  &quot;<em>For reasons not  relevant to this research ..</em>.&quot; I do not want my wife to find out</p>
	  <h5>POSTSCRIPT</h5>
	  <p>Over the years student essays and examination papers have thrown  up their proper share of snafus and unmeant puns. I have been collecting these,  on and off, for some time, and offer them for general consumption with no  ulterior motive or agenda. </p>
