	  <h5>BRANCH POST OFFICES OF PORT ELIZABETH, 1822-1910
	    </h5>
	    </h5>
	  <p align="left">Franco Frescura</p>
	  <h5>INTRODUCTION</h5>
	  <p>This article is based upon information gathered during the course  of a research project conducted upon the history of the Cape Colonial Post  Office up to 1910. Because this survey covered over 2500 different post  offices, it follows that research of a more detailed nature was impossible in  many cases. Consequently I hope that local historians having further  information of an archival or anecdotal nature will consider making some of  this data available for publication. In addition to the main post office in Market Square, the  following post and telegraph offices were listed for Port Elizabeth:</p>
	  <p>Adderley    Street. Adderley Street  was named in honour of Charles B Adderley, a British member of Parliament who  supported the Colony's successful campaign against British plans to turn the Cape into a convict station. Two post offices are known  to have been opened in Adderley    Street. The first was opened on 1 February 1882,  and in May1893 it was moved to Queen    Street and renamed accordingly (see QUEEN STREET). In  March 1903 a new post office was opened in Adderley Street to meet the needs of a  growing population in the industrial suburbs of North End and Sydenham. It  remained open until 7 July 1928 when it was abolished. On 1 February 1909 Miss  ML Altensted was appointed as its postmaster. In addition to their local post  office, during the 1890s members of the public living in or near Adderley Street  could also purchase stamps from John Monk, and J Schorn.</p>
	  <p>Agricultural Show. A temporary telegraph office was opened at the Port Elizabeth  Showgrounds in 1896.</p>
	  <p>Amsterdam Flats. The name commemorates the loss of the Amsterdam,  a ship belonging to the Dutch East India Company which arrived in Algoa Bay  on 15 December 1817 in a heavy storm. In an effort to save the lives of those  aboard, her captain beached her between the Swartkops and Coega rivers. The  post office of Amsterdam Flats was opened in the division of Port Elizabeth on 23 December 1854 with Mr W  Adcock as its postmaster. On 11 January 1855 its establishment was transferred,  together with its postmaster, to Zwarte Koppen, in the division of Uitenhage,  and its name was changed to Zwarte Koppen (Amsterdam Flats).</p>
	  <p>Bird Island. Bird  Island is the largest of a group of  small rocky outcrops located about 64km east of Port Elizabeth, and probably derived its name  from the large number of seagulls which nest there. The first lighthouse was  commissioned in 1852 and consisted of a pyramidal timber structure some 13m  high. In 1872 work was begun on a permanent structure built in stone imported  from the mainland. The project was supervised by Joseph Flack, and was  completed in May 1873. A post office was opened on Bird Island  on 1 May 1872. Mr J Reid, the lighthouse keeper, was appointed its postmaster  and rendered this service gratis. Given its brief existence, it seems probable  that his post office was only opened to service the needs of its construction  crew.</p>
	  <p>Cape Receife. Work on the lighthouse on Cape Receife  was begun in about 1848 and completed the following year. The octagonal stone  structure was designed by Col Charles Mitchell, Surveyor General of the Cape 1828-48, and stood 24m in height. It overlooked the  approaches to Port Elizabeth, most particularly the treacherous Thunderbolt  Reef and Roman Rock, both of which had proven, over the years, to be  particularly dangerous to coastal shipping. The telegraph office at Cape Receiffe  was opened in about 1885.</p>
	  <p>East Walmer. The post office at East   Walmer was only open for about six months, from April through to  September 1907.</p>
	  <p>Greenbushes.  The post office at Greenbushes was first listed in 1877, and although it drops  out of official records until 1882, it seems likely that it was open throughout  this time. It was abolished in January 1888 but was reopened again on 5 March  1923.</p>
	  <p>Humewood.  The post office at Humewood was open from February 1894 through to October  1896. It was reopened on 1 January 1913. The suburb of Humewood was established  in 1860, and was named in honour of an early land developer, called Hume, who  had been instrumental in the reclamation of drift-sands on the outskirts of Port Elizabeth. This had  been achieved by the planting Port Jackson willows imported from Australia. The  railway line from Port Elizabeth  was extended to Humewood on 1 April 1906.</p>
	  <p>Humewood Station. A telegraph office was opened at Humewood Station on 1 January  1910.</p>
	  <p>Korsten.  The suburb of Korsten was named after Frederick Korsten, one of the first  traders to settle at Algoa   Bay. It was established  in 1896, but only began to develop after 1902 when, following an outbreak of  bubonic plague in PortElizabeth, the town's  Black population was forcibly resettled in nearby New Brighton. Many families chose to live in  Kirsten instead, not only because it was closer to town, but also because it  had a more relaxed attitude towards the illegal brewing of maize beer. The post  office at Korsten was opened in August 1904.</p>
	  <p>Lawrence    Street. The post office at Lawrence    Street was opened on 1 February 1882, and a  telegraph office was opened in 1894. In 1896 it was refitted and transferred to  new premises. However its work grew rapidly, and in 1898 it was extended to  incorporate an adjoining room. In 1906 burglars entered its offices but failed  to break open its safe and nothing of value was taken. The following postal  officials are recorded to have been employed there:</p>
	  <blockquote>
	    <p>Skea, J 1883<br />
	      Colegate, Miss Florence 1 July 1886<br />
	      Chamen, GC, ex Adelaide 1 August 1896<br />
	      Hardy, JE, moved to Clanwilliam 1  September 1897<br />
	      Stanley, Miss AM, moved to Jansenville 1 May 1899<br />
	      Jordan, HG, ex Port Alfred, moved to  Hopetown 1 August 1900<br />
	      Gace, FJ, ex Hope Town, moved to  Jansenville 1 December 1900<br />
	      Johnston, J 1 January 1903<br />
	      Bilk, G, ex Hope Town, moved to Douglas 1 June 1903<br />
	      Keenan, D, ex Douglas  1 April 1904<br />
	      Spencer, GR 1 August 1905<br />
	      Kelly, PJ 1 December 1905<br />
	      Archer, T 1909</p>
	    </blockquote>
	  <p>New    Brighton Location.  During the South African War the British military authorities imported a large  number of horses from Argentina.  Unfortunately their fodder was infested with vermin which carried Bubonic  plague and, between 1901 and 1903, most of South Africa's major towns recorded  outbreaks of this disease. The plague reached Port Elizabeth in 1901, and although its  spread affected all sectors of the population, it was the black community who  bore the brunt of the Plague Health Regulations. In 1902 most of Port Elizabeth's black  suburbs were demolished, the personal belongings of their residents were  arbitrarily destroyed, and restrictions were imposed upon inter-town travel.  The racially segregated suburb of New Brighton  was established in 1902 on the outskirts of Port Elizabeth, some 8km north of the city  centre, to house families who had been displaced during the plague outbreak. By  1911 its population had grown to 3,650 persons, almost all of them black. In  August 1903 a post office, operated by the Assistant Resident Magistrate, was  established on an experimental basis. It was proposed, in due course, to  provide it with premises in the new public buildings then in the planning  process. This project appears to have been completed in 1907. In addition to  their local post office, during the 1890s the residents of New Brighton  Location could also purchase stamps from J Rogers.</p>
	  <p>New    Brighton Station.  The post office at New Brighton Station was opened in about October 1903, and  in 1909 it was provided with telegraph facilities.</p>
	  <p>North End.  North End developed as a mixed land-use suburb immediately north of the Port Elizabeth town  centre. In 1861 a Receiving Office was established in the shop of Anne Rich,  opposite the North End Jail. The railway line from Port Elizabeth Station was  extended to North End on 26 July 1875, and a post office was opened at North  End Station on 1 April 1876. In 1894 it was provided with telegraph facilities,  and 1895 its offices were refitted. However it was apparent that the amount of  space which the Railway Department was prepared to give over to the post office  was limited, and although plans for new facilities were put forward, it soon  became obvious that the funds necessary for the project would not become  available in the foreseeable future. Consequently, in about April 1903, the  post office moved its business to premises off the station's property and, at the  same time, abridged its name to North End. According to records the following  officials were employed there as postmaster:</p>
	  <blockquote>
	    <p>Powell, GL, ex Barroe 1 April 1876<br />
	      Kaye-Brooke, H, station master moved to  Coega 1 September 1877<br />
	      Gleeson, P, ex Berlin Station 1 April 1878<br />
	      Hall, JC, station master 1 July 1879<br />
	      Dyke, JF 1 July 1894<br />
	      Fowler, J 1880<br />
	      Dublin, RJ 1881<br />
	      Murdoch, JC, moved to Britstown 1 July  1896<br />
	      Honiball, JF, ex Britstown, moved to  Willowmore 16 April 1900<br />
	      Borcherds, PB, ex Calitzdorp moved to  Vosburg 1 April 1902<br />
	      Gernetzky, FW, moved to Steynsburg 1 April  1903<br />
	      Eve, FJ, ex Steynsburg, moved to Rosmead 1  June 1903<br />
	      Tarbett, J 1 August 1908<br />
	      Bray, AR 1 June 1910</p>
	    </blockquote>
	  <p>In addition to their local post office, during the 1890s members  of the public living near North End, Port    Elizabeth, could also purchase stamps from W  Armstrong, Distributor of Native Letters. On 21 May 1901 burglars broke into  the office and made off with about 5 pounds in stamps. Another forced entry  took place in 1905, but the culprits failed to breakopen the safe and nothing  of value was taken.</p>
	  <p>Queen Street.  The post office in Adderley Street  was opened on 1 February1882. In May 1893 it was moved to new premises in Queen Street and  was renamed accordingly. It was closed down in June 1894, and was reopened in  January 1896. This, however, was of brief duration, and it was closed down  again in May 1896, probably for want of suitable premises. It was only reopened  three years later, in May 1899, as a branch post and telegraph office, once  suitable accomodation in Queen Street had again become available. The following  officials were employed there as postmaster:</p>
	  <blockquote>
	    <p>Francis, AW 1883<br />
	      Schorn, John 1 May 1885<br />
	      Eva, FM 1 May 1899<br />
	      Barbey, GW, ex Taungs 1 April 1903<br />
	      Ullyett, AG, ex Wellington Station 1 December 1903<br />
	      Begley, DC, ex  Port Alfred, moved to Port Elizabeth  1 November 1906<br />
	      Wadley, WD 1 October 1908</p>
	    </blockquote>
	  <p>In addition to their local post office, during the 1890s members  of the public living in or near Queen Street, Port Elizabeth, could also  purchase stamps from the following licensed stamp vendors: WA Howard (Grocer),  Jos Johns (11 Queen Street), James Naylor, W Singson (92 Queen Street), JO  Walker &amp; Co, and E Walsh.</p>
	  <p>Race Course.  A temporary telegraph office was opened at the Port Elizabeth race course on 15 October  1898.</p>
	  <p>Richmond    Hill. Richmond Hill was a residential  suburb of Port Elizabeth.  A post office serving the area, including money order and savings bank  facilities, was opened 15 June 1896. On 21 December 1903 its premises were  completely gutted by fire. All post office stores, as well as about 2 pounds in  cash and stamps, were destroyed. The following officials were employed there as  postmaster:</p>
	  <blockquote>
	    <p>Harvey, AJ 15 June 1896<br />
	      Whitaker, PH 1 August 1907</p>
	    </blockquote>
	  <p>In addition to their local post office, during the 1890s members  of the public living near Richmond    Hill could also purchase stamps from AR Cooke.</p>
	  <p>St    George&rsquo;s Park. A temporary telegraph office was opened  at St George's Park in 1888.</p>
	  <p>South End.  South End was a suburb of Port    Elizabeth located south of its commercial centre, and  was originally considered by local citizens to be &quot;over the river&quot;.  Settlement began in the 1860s when a few fine houses were erected in the area.  After the stabilisation of sand dunes began in the 1870s, there was a marked  increase in residential development, and when the Railways began to take over  land immediately to its north in the 1880s, the Malay community which occupied  that area was resettled in South End. Thereafter the suburb began to develop a  racially-mixed working class character which it retained until the 1960s when  residents who did not qualify as &quot;White&quot; under South Africa's  Apartheid laws were forcibly removed to specially designated areas north of the  city. The post office at South End was opened in August 1894 and closed in  November 1895. It was reopened in July 1901 and closed down again in June 1902.  It was reopened soon thereafter in August 1902. In 1903 its establishment was  removed to a larger and more convenient building. The following officials were  employed there as postmaster:</p>
	  <blockquote>
	    <p>Garner, DG 1 September 1902<br />
	      Crittall, A 1 March 1903<br />
	      Thackham, W 1 August 1903</p>
	    </blockquote>
	  <p>South    Union Street. The post office at South    Union Street was opened on 1 February 1882 and  closed in April 1884. It may have been reopened in 1900. In addition to their  local post office, during the 1890s members of the public living near South Union Street  could also purchase stamps from the following licensed stamp vendors: DD Blend,  and HC Gibb.</p>
	  <p>Walmer.  Walmer was established in 1857 on the farm Welbedacht, and was named after Walmer Castle,  the family seat of the Duke of Welligton. After the stabilisation of the sand  dunes south of Port Elizabeth,  it became popular as a residential area for the town's merchant classes and was  granted separate municipal status in 1899. The 1891 census indicated that it  had a population of 527. By 1904 this number had risen to 1,928. The post  office at Walmer was opened in December1891, and was provided with telegraph  facilities in 1901. The railway line from Valley Junction reached the suburb on  15 December 1906. The following officials were employed there as postmaster:</p>
	  <blockquote>
	    <p>Jones, ATD 1 February 1903<br />
	      Johnson, WAE 1 December 1905</p>
	    </blockquote>
	  <p>Zwartkops Station. The railway line from Port    Elizabeth reached Zwartkops on 26 July 1875, and a  post office was opened at Zwartkops Station on 1 September 1875. In about 1885  it was provided with telegraph facilities. The following officials were  employed there as postmaster:</p>
	  <blockquote>
	    <p>Sanderson, J, station master 1 September  1875<br />
	      Easley, J, station master, moved to  Uitenhage Station 1 March 1876<br />
	      De Bene, J, station master 15 June 1878<br />
	      Bellingham, J, station master 22 October 1879<br />
	      Birch, J 1880</p>
	    </blockquote>
	  <p>In addition to their local post office, during the 1890s the  residents of Zwartkops could also purchase stamps from E   Alcock. </p>
	  <p>Zwartkops Sorting Tender. The Zwartkops Sorting Tender was a travelling post office which  ran on a daily basis between Zwartkops and Uitenhage. It was opened in August  1883 but was abandoned early in 1898 as a result of changes in local train schedules.  At its onset the GPO also considered the possibility of extending its range to  Grahamstown, but it is not known whether this was ever implemented.</p>
