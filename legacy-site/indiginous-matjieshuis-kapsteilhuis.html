        <h5 align="left">FROM MATJIESHUIS TO KAPSTEILHUIS - 
          Cross Cultural Borrowings in Cape Migrant  Pastoralist Sub-culture</h5>
        <p align="left">Franco Frescura</p>
        <h5>INTRODUCTION</h5>
        <p>One of the beliefs most fondly entertained by the white South  African community holds that the arrival of their ancestors to the Cape in 1652 was to bring about, in the course of time, a  variety of deep seated changes in the material culture and behavioral patterns  of their black neighbours. They point out, not without a measure of pride, to  the success enjoyed by missionaries in proselytizing indigenous groups to the  Christian faith; to the fact that these same people were induced to wear  clothes with relatively little effort; and to the degree with which western  artifacts and materials have been assimilated into local building traditions  and lifestyle. Matthew Blythe, Agent to the Mfengu for the Cape Colonial  Government, reported in 1875, for example that:</p>
        <p>&quot;The social condition of the Fingoes  has certainly advanced during the past year; some headmen and people have built  and are building good houses of brick and stone. Clothing is much more work. In  many of their homes plates, tables, chairs, beds, etc. are in common use.&quot; </p>
        <p>In more recent times however such statements have become the  subject of more stringent analysis as a variety of historians have questioned  not only their exact meaning but also their veracity. They point out, for  example, that the first white settlers to southern Africa  did not arrive in 1652 but exactly one hundred years earlier, albeit somewhat  unwillingly, and only as the result of shipwrecks on the eastern seaboard.  Missionary successes have also been brought into some doubt. Livingstone, for  example, is only recorded to have made one convert in his whole missionary  career, and even this lone soul is thought to have recanted as soon as his  pastor returned to Scotland.  Writing more recently Donovan Williams has pointed out that:</p>
        <p>&quot;<em>Of the missionary failure in (the Transkei) there  is no doubt. Even today the amaXhosa is not a Christian nation ... The fact that  abaKweta ceremonies take place two miles from the University College of Fort  Hare in the year 1959 symbolises the missionary failure significantly to  influence the way of life of the rank and file amaXhosa.</em>&quot; </p>
        <p>In my own work, conducted over this last decade, I have been able  to show that whilst there has been an undoubted influx of mass-produced  industrial material into the rural built environment, affecting the use of  decoration, of dwelling forms and of building technology, none of these could  be considered to be deep seated enough to strike at the &quot;cultural core&quot;  of southern Africa's rural architecture. Indeed, when I began to analyze the  fundamental principles of this built environment I discovered that, if  anything, such changes in material culture had been incorporated into local  building customs and often reinterpreted and given new meaning in terms of  local value systems.</p>
        <p>Thus when we read the report made in 1880 by John R Thompson,  Government Magistrate for Gatberg, in Griqualand East, to the effect that &quot;<em>The  square plan ... is superseding the old grass huts</em>&rdquo; we should also consider  the fact that today the circular plan unit remains the single most popular  dwelling form, not only in Griqualand East but also throughout rural southern  Africa.</p>
        <p>This does not mean to say that there were no cross-cultural  transmissions in architecture between immigrant white and indigenous black  communities. There undoubtedly were. As early as 1775 Sparrman reported that  Khoikhoi in the Outeniquas were building dwellings &quot;in a square form,  with shelving roofs, like the cottages of the slaves&quot;, but by  this time the Khoikhoi had been in contact with the Dutch for over a century  during which time they had been decimated by smallpox, dispossessed of their  lands and, in many cases, indentured to white farmers. It is no surprise that,  at some stage, they should also begin building their dwellings in emulation of  their conquerors. Indeed some years later, in 1840, Backhouse was led to report  on the progress made by the Khoikhoi residing on the mission station of  Groenekloof, no doubt under considerable missionary pressure. He stated that:</p>
        <p>&quot;<em>Their first habitations were usually  of rushes; they next built hartebeest houses of better quality; and many had  superseded these by neat comfortable cottages; well built and thatched.</em>&quot;</p>
        <p>However it should be realised that this cultural trans-migration  of architectural forms was not a simple one-way traffic. In spite of John  Campbell's warning made in 1815 to the effect that:</p>
        <p>&quot;<em>Missionary stations are surrounded  by moral atmospheres, or have a moral and civilising influence to a  considerable distance around, beyond which it is extremely hazardous for white  men to go.</em>&quot;</p>
        <p>many white men, as well as whole families, strayed from the &quot;moral  atmosphere&quot; of mission stations and settled in remote areas of  southern Africa, often beyond the demarcated  boundaries of the Colony.</p>
        <h5>GEOGRAPHICAL  DEMARCATION</h5>
        <p>This paper deals with that portion of southern Africa  which, during the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, became associated  with the architecture, culture and lifestyle of migrant pastoralist farmers and  graziers. This is being interpreted in its widest cultural and geographical  sense, and should be seen to encompass the major part of the southern African  hinterland, including the northern Cape and  southern Namibia through to  southern Botswana, the  western Transvaal, the northern and central OFS down to the eastern Cape and Border region. For the sake  of completing the picture I also intend to quote, very briefly, examples from Lesotho, the Transvaal and Zimbabwe.</p>
        <h5>THE  INDIGENOUS INFLUENCE IN THE CAPE AND ITS  HINTERLAND</h5>
        <p>An important factor which has gone largely unexplored thus far  relates to the numerous recorded cases of European families immigrant to the  region who adopted indigenous building forms and technologies and made them  their own.</p>
        <p>This began as early as 1552 when some 220 white survivors from the  Portuguese slaver the Sao Joao were shipwrecked near present-day Port  Edward. It is estimated that between 1552 and 1782 some one thousand whites  were marooned in a similar manner on the eastern coast of southern Africa. Although many of these made their way back to  their homes, usually via Mocambique, others died during this journey whilst  some prudently chose to remain behind. No figures for these early settlers are  available but numerous reports tell how survivors from one shipwreck would  travel up the coast only to come across people who had been stranded there  twenty years previously and, in the interim, had become assimilated into local  communities, had taken local spouses and had generally flourished. No cases are  recorded where these persons had built their homes in a European manner. All  appear to have adopted local building customs as part of their integration with  local culture.</p>
        <p>Understandably intermarriage between white and black appears to  have been a key factor in the transmission of indigenous architectural forms to  white colonial society and although such examples do not seem to have been  numerous, sufficient numbers were documented for us to derive some conclusions.  Writing in 1820 Campbell  reported that:</p>
        <p><em>&quot;Kreega (Kriege), a boor from the  colony, lived among the Griquas about fourteen years ago, when Dr. Cowan and  his party were on their journey into the interior ... Kreega left four or five  wives behind, and a considerable stock of cattle.</em>&quot;</p>
        <p>Campbell omits to tell us what Kriege's homestead  looked like but it is safe to assume that he and his extended family lived in  Khoi mat huts. Backhouse tells of a similar example he came across at  Kokfontein in Namaqualand in 1839 where:</p>
        <p>&quot;<em>Near the ford, the family of an aged  Boor was residing in mat-huts. We did not visit him, as his wife, who was a  (Khoikhoi), said he was so deaf, that we could not make him hear</em>&quot;.</p>
        <p>The same author wrote earlier that year of another family in the  southern OFS where <em>&quot;a Welshman, who had married a Bechuana woman, was  living in a poor, roof-like hut of reeds, near a spring&quot;.</em></p>
        <p>Backhouse's description leaves no doubt as to the fact that this  dwelling must have been a kapsteilhuis. This example therefore is one of  the earliest recorded cases of a white-black marriage where the family did not  build their dwellings in an altogether indigenous style, although it could be argued  that the kapsteilhuis represents a reasonable compromise between white  expectations of dwelling form and an indigenous availability of materials.</p>
        <p>Unlike these cases where white men married local women and settled  down among indigenous groups, there are other examples of people who, as a  matter of choice, conformed their dwellings to local architectural norms.  Although in many cases these were not permanent but merely aimed at meeting the  settlers' short-term needs for shelter, in a small number of instances they  were upgraded and became part of their new vocabulary of settlement. This  standpoint was put forward as late as 1935 by the Government of Southern  Rhodesia when they argued that:</p>
        <p>&quot;<em>As a purely temporary dwelling, huts  of pole and dagga ... under a thatched roof are satisfactory. These can be  either round or square, and separate huts can be used as sleeping and living  rooms ... they should be so placed that when the permanent homestead is built  they can be used as 'outside' or store rooms.</em>&quot;</p>
        <p>One of the earliest cases recorded was that of the missionary Van  der Kemp who not only lived among the Khoi in a traditional mat hut, but went  so far as to take a local girl to wife. His philosophy was that he could not  inspire his &quot;flock&quot; with a love of God unless he was himself  willing to share in their privations and style of life. Needless to say his  methods did not meet with the approval of other whites. Lichtenstein wrote in  1804 that:</p>
        <p>&quot;... <em>he would surely have done much  better ... to have inspired them with some sort of taste for the refinements of  civilization, rather than to have levelled himself with them, and adopted their  habits of negligence and filth. It appears to me that Van der Kemp is of little  value as a missionary, ..</em>.&quot;</p>
        <p>while Campbell commented nine  years later that:</p>
        <p>&quot;... <em>had the founder of Bethelsdorp  been more aware of the importance of civilization, there might at least have  been more external appearance to it than there is now ... The Doctor would  appear in public without hat, stockings or shoes, and probably without a coat.  I leave it to commentators to determine how far that passage did or did not  countenance his practice; ...</em>&quot;</p>
        <p>As it turned out, such value judgments were premature. Subsequent  missionaries to Bethelsdorp scarcely managed any better with the resources  available to them, although none of them are recorded to have appeared barefoot  and hatless in public.</p>
        <p>Most other instances recorded during this period relate to the  dwellings of Dutch pastoralists who, having observed at first hand the  advantages of the Khoi lifestyle, adapted to it quite readily. Barrow recorded  such an instance in the Khamiesberge in 1797 where:</p>
        <p>&quot;<em>We took shelter in the solitary  hovel of a Dutch peasant, that stood on the general summit of the mountain.  Cold as it was, the man and his family had no other habitation than a hut made  of rush matting, and fashioned after the manner of the Namaquas,</em>&quot;</p>
        <p>He, like  most other town people, looked down upon these graziers, regarding them as:</p>
        <p>&quot;... <em>a class of men ... the least  advanced in civilization. Many of them, towards the borders of the settlement,  are perfect Nomads, wander about from place to place without any fixed  habitation, and live in straw huts similar to those of the (Khoikhoi).</em>&quot;</p>
        <p>Within a generation or two of Barrow, however, much of the stigma  attached to Khoi mat beehive dwellings was to disappear as more and more  missionaries found these perfectly adequate to meet their immediate housing  needs. Backhouse tells of one case in Namaqualand  in 1839 where:</p>
        <p>&quot;<em>Michael Wimmer constantly left Kok  Fontein in the winter; he packed up three mat huts, which then served him as a  dwelling, a chapel, and a kitchen, and removed with his wagon and cart, to the  places where most of the people were sojourning.</em>&quot;</p>
        <p>Other missionaries also found the Khoi mat dwelling, or matjieshuis  as it became known, quite sufficient for their needs. Campbell  recorded that the missionaries at Silver Fountain, in Namaqualand:</p>
        <p>&quot;<em>All live in huts covered with mats of rushes, the same as  the ordinary (Khoikhoi) houses, only those belonging to Cornelius Kok and Mr  Sass are much larger, so that a person can walk about in them.</em>&quot;</p>
        <p>However it is probable that the missionaries did not adopt this  style of architecture only for political reasons, in order to get closer to  their brethren, but also because such dwellings were suited to the local  economy and the migrant pastoralist lifestyle of their inhabitants. Once white  pastoralist farmers began to supplant the Khoikhoi in the Cape  interior, in many cases they also assumed the latter's architecture and  lifestyle. Thompson visited the Kamiesberg in 1823 and there recorded that a  Dutch grazier &quot;was living in a rude Namaqua hut, though apparently a  person of considerable substance&quot;, whilst at nearby Buffelsfontein he  reported finding the farmer, a man called Coetzee &quot;also living in a  Namaqua hut, without either garden or corn-field, but with extensive kraals  full of sheep and cattle&quot;.</p>
        <p>In these terms therefore the architecture of the Khoikhoi will be  seen as a response to two separate sets of factors: the prevailing migrant  pastoralist economy of the region; and the availability of suitable building  materials, most especially reeds, necessary for the manufacture of the matjieshuis.</p>
        <p>The first is self-evident. A farming community which depends upon  the continued availability of grazing for its economic survival and who  inhabits a region of fluctuating grazing resources, will be forced to develop  an architecture which responds in every way to their lifestyle. The graziers of  this region, most specifically the arid central and northern Cape led a hard existence in what  could, at times, be a harsh environment. Their dwellings had to be strictly  functional and as transportable as possible. Thus whilst some Dutch farmers  there lived in either tents or their ox-wagons, many others opted for the tried  and tested architectural tradition of their predecessors. In the process, an  equation was created between the matjieshuis and the ox-wagon and it is  not at all certain that the latter was the better choice of the two. It also  means that South African architectural historians should be revising their  long-held definitions of a dwelling to incorporate the ox-wagon tradition.</p>
        <p>The second factor is perhaps a little more difficult to examine,  not because of the technology involved, but because so little is known to us as  to how its transfer took place. It must be assumed that if the matjieshuis  was, as is recorded, the preferred dwelling of Khoikhoi pastoralists, and that  subsequently this domestic form became associated with the Dutch who supplanted  them, then a transmission of both its form and technology must have occurred  between the two groups. We must therefore ask what the exact mechanics were of  such a transfer. Did Khoikhoi servants for example build and maintain such  dwellings or were they purchased as part of a local barter system? If the  latter was indeed the case then was some kind of micro trade pattern  established to supply Dutch householders with new mats for their existing  dwellings? Did the Dutch learn the skills necessary to build matjieshuise  and if so who taught them? If the Dutch did indeed learn such skills then was  there a division of labour between the genders as is known to have existed in  indigenous society? Did the Dutch ever gain a knowledge of the physiognomic  symbolism involved in the matting cover and if so how was this incorporated  into their own culture and value system? Were Dutch mat shelters laid out  according to any pattern pre-established by cognitive spatial distributions?  Were Khoikhoi spatial distributions also acquired and observed?</p>
        <p>And my final question must be: at what point did this transmission  actually stop? We do know that some intermarriage between Khoi and Dutch took  place; what we do not know is to what degree Khoikhoi life and value systems  permeated into the Dutch farming community.</p>
        <h5>THE  INDIGENOUS INFLUENCE ELSEWHERE IN SOUTHERN AFRICA</h5>
        <p>Finally I would like to examine a few examples of cross-cultural  influence between indigenous and immigrant cultures as they took place  elsewhere in southern Africa. One famous  example was recorded in Grahamstown in 1850 where Bishop Merriman built a study  in his own garden in the form of a beehive hut after the mFengu model. He was  quite precise in his opinions on housing and wrote in his journal in 1849 that:</p>
        <p>&quot;On riding into Bathurst I visited the (mFengu) settlement  near the village where I went to look for a good hut as a pattern of one which  I intend to build as a study for myself on the lawn before my house. But there  were no very good ones there. In fact the people are, under the persuasion of  their teachers and governors, changing their round huts for miserable mud  hovels built in European shape. The only advantage they gain by this is the power  of dividing the hut into 2 rooms, but as they have no fire places or chimneys I  could not see that much was gained by this sort of reform.&quot;</p>
        <p>Also in the eastern Cape  the trader Harris a similar dwelling for himself near the White Kei in c1848.  Baines described it in his journal:</p>
        <p><em>&quot;... we halted for a short time  opposite the station of an English trader named Harris, who with his wife and  family occupied a hut of similar form but of larger dimensions than those  usually inhabited by the (Xhosa). The interior, which formed a room of between  twenty and thirty feet in length, was lighted by a single tier of small  loopholes; the roof was supported by two or three upright pillars;</em>&quot;</p>
        <p>Despite the rapid spread of immigrant settlement, and hence  infrastructure, into the southern African interior from the 1880s onwards, the  white use of indigenous forms continued well into the 1890s and probably even  later. Widdicombe built a set of quite substantial cone on cylinder structures  at Thlotse Heights, Lesotho, in 1877 at a total cost of  &pound;60,  and these served as mission quarters for nearly a decade. Further inland the  first administrative buildings erected in Harare  in 1890 were Shona cone on cylinder dwellings, as was the first church in Bulawayo. Structures of a  similar nature were also functional during the early part of the twentieth  century on local Swedish, Trappist and Swiss mission stations but the dates of  their construction are not known. Kearney has  suggested that white, specifically English, immigrants to southern Africa may have been particularly susceptible to the  charms of what he calls the &quot;Bundu Style&quot;. He argues that the  picturesque movement was derived from an English fondness for natural scenery;  that the indigenous architecture that explorers found in the course of their  journeys of discovery during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries was  evocative of a rural charm which their own industrialization had but recently  desecrated. Thus it was only natural that once they came into contact with  local vernacular styles, they should adopt many of these features and  incorporate them into their own colonial dwellings.</p>
        <h5>CONCLUSIONS</h5>
        <p>It is clearly a difficult matter to bring together groups of  migrant graziers, missionaries, liberal churchmen and white settlers and  attempt to find the one common factor that could link them and explain why each  chose to abandon its own architectural traditions in favour of those of another  group. It is probable that the country's natural environment played a strong  role in influencing their respective choice of dwelling form but, at the same  time, we should also ask whether this choice was not guided by some overriding  instinct, some subconscious wish perhaps to find greater identification with  the country that was to become their new home.</p>
        <p>It is noticeable however that the majority of examples quoted  above were recorded during the first half of the eighteenth century. As such  they pre-date the major period of colonial expansion in southern Africa, the  consolidation of white settlement in the Transvaal, OFS and Natal, the laying down of a railway  infrastructure, and the discovery of diamonds and gold in the interior. They  preceded the time when indigenous culture and architecture both began to find  reference in vitriolic and xenophobic terms, when writers such as the  missionary John Mackenzie wrote about &quot;reeking and offensive hovels  which you fear may contaminate your neighbourhood&quot; and their  inhabitants were described by the missionary Wilkinson as being &quot;low  down in the scale of civilization&quot;.</p>
        <p>These sentiments stand in stark contrast with those expressed by  Barrow, Burchell, Campbell, Smith and Backhouse a bare two generations earlier.  Burchell told in 1811 how the Tswana town of Dithakong &quot;excited astonishment&quot;  while the novel form and character of their houses seized his whole attention.</p>
        <p>Quite clearly then those early settlers to the interior of  southern Africa adapted to local architectural  values to a large extent because of a pragmatic need for shelter. They also  lived in an era which still believed in Rosseau's &quot;noble savage&quot;  and strengthened by their own ideal of the picturesque, were able to make their  homes in a style which they perceived to be appropriate in the context of their  new environment. Subsequent generations had no such illusions and made no such  attempt to adapt to local values.</p>
        <p>It might also be pertinent to consider that, until the 1850s,  competition for land between immigrant white settlers and indigenous  communities had not yet become a matter for widespread armed resistance. It is  not difficult to see how dwellings which &quot;excited astonishment&quot;  in 1811 could have been transformed into &quot;reeking and offensive hovels&rdquo;  forty years later as part of a wider and deliberate programme of denigration of  indigenous values aimed at subverting their moral claims to ancestral lands.</p>
        <h5>POSTSCRIPT</h5>
        <p>This paper originally formed the basis for the Mary Alexander Cooke Memorial Lecture and keynote address, delivered  in Worcester on  21 September 1989 to the Western Cape Branch of the South African Museums  Association Annual Conference on Living History, under the title of From  Matjieshuis to Kapsteilhuis: Cross-cultural Borrowings in Cape Migrant  Pastoralist Sub-culture. It has since been extensively revised. I was  pleasurably surprised to note that, to date, it has never been submitted for  publication to any journal, something I propose to rectify at the earliest  opportunity.</p>
