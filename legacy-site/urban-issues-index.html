	    Urban issues </h5>
	  <p>It is true that, in many respects, the roots of racial segregation  can be traced back to the nineteenth century and the strictures that colonial  society imposed upon southern Africa's urban  areas. Case studies in the region seem to indicate that our suburbs were often  integrated to a larger degree than is generally admitted by Apartheid's  historians, and although black and white were uneasy neighbours, they generally  appear to have shared urban facilities with a measure of success. Disputes  between the two communities usually arose over the occupation of coveted  residential land, an issue which was often linked by whites to the question of  public health. Occasionally matters reached a critical point, such as in  1901-1903 when the British importation of fodder from Argentina  brought about a nation-wide outbreak of Bubonic Plague. Upon this occasion the  authorities unilaterally imposed draconian restrictions upon the Black  population, demolished their homes, burned their belongings, and displaced  entire communities to sites well beyond the city boundaries. Barring such  instances, however, planning decisions which created social divisions were  generally made by planners on an ad hoc basis, and were largely guided by  considerations of economic class.</p>
	  <p>A major turning point was reached in 1923 when the Union  Parliament passed the Natives (Urban Areas) Act, which laid down the principles  of residential segregation and reinforced the doctrine that the African  population had no permanent rights in the towns. In spite of this, the now  &quot;white&quot; suburbs remained racially integrated to varying  degrees until 1948 when the Nationalist Party came to power. At that stage the  process of separating communities was placed upon an ideological footing, and  was given substance by a variety of inter-linking residential, squatting,  labour and security legislation. Although, over the years, the dialectic of  Apartheid has tended to change, its net effect upon the black community has  involved the dispossession of their homes and land, often with minimal  recompense. They have also been denied access to markets, infrastructure and  civic amenities, leading to impoverishment and increased economic hardship.</p>
