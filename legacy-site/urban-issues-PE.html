	  <h5><br />PORT ELIZABETH - 
	    An Abridged History of the Apartheid City</h5>
	  <p>Franco Frescura</p>
	  <h5>INTRODUCTION</h5>
	  <p>The first immigrant structure in Port Elizabeth was erected by the British in  August 1799. Named Fort Frederick, after Frederick,  Duke of York, its main function was to guard the landing place and water  supplies at Algoa   Bay. It is also probable  that the British intended to establish a military presence in the region to  deter potential Dutch uprisings in the district of Graaff-Reinet, and to  protect Cape Town, and hence the India sea  route, from possible French attack. The township  of Port Elizabeth was laid out in  1815, but was not developed until 1820 when some 5000 British settlers arrived  in the Eastern Cape.  The economic development of the village was initially slow. James Backhouse  (1844), who visited the place in December 1838, reported that:</p>
	  <p>&quot;<em>Port Elizabeth is situated on the  foot of a steep hill, at the margin of Algoa Bay; it is much like a small,  English sea-port town, and contains about 100 houses, exclusive of huts; the  houses are of stone or brick, red-tiled, and of English structure. The town is  said to have been chiefly raised by the sale of strong drink.</em>&quot;</p>
	  <p>Thus at its onset Port Elizabeth  served predominantly as a service centre for the agricultural hinterland of the  Eastern Cape.  Its basic function was to handle, and later process, goods and materials  passing through its harbour. However developments elsewhere in the southern  African interior provided economic stimulus to the new town, and by the 1860s it  had overtaken Cape Town  as the Colony's premier port. The growth of an ostrich feather industry in  Graaff-Reinet, Oudtshoorn and the Albany, the  discovery of diamonds in the northern Cape and  of gold in the Transvaal, and the outbreak of wars against the Boer Republics,  were all to benefit Port Elizabeth.  As a result, in the early years of the twentieth Century, numerous  manufacturing industries began to be established locally, most notable being a  number of motor vehicle assembly plants, which created extensive employment  opportunities. This, as well as increasing rural poverty in the region,  attracted many workers to the town to the point that, until the 1960s, it  maintained its place as South    Africa's third largest urban centre.</p>
	  <p>Port Elizabeth, as it stands today, owes its form to a  number of physical and historical constraints. However, since the early 1900s,  colonial segregation planning and a policy of statutary racial separation  implemented after 1950, has resulted in what has become a protypical model of  the &quot;<em>Apartheid city</em>&quot;.</p>
	  <h5>COLONIAL  SEGREGATION</h5>
	  <p>The early population of Port    Elizabeth consisted, in the main, of Europeans, as  well as persons of mixed race which the Apartheid system subsequently labelled  as &quot;Coloureds&quot; and &quot;Cape Malays&quot;. Initially few  members of the indigenous population were attracted to the town and, almost  from the onset, economic status was related to skin colour. Whites held a  virtual monopoly over higher paid jobs and consequently could afford better  housing in areas which were usually physically removed from &quot;other&quot;  groups. Thus segregation was an integral part of early Port Elizabeth, with the industrial areas of  South End and North End being predominantly Coloured, while the Central and  Western suburbs were mainly White. However, while White attitudes to Coloured  and Malay citizens remained relatively tolerant, official policies toward  indigenous residents were markedly different.</p>
	  <p>Thus, as a rising number of Black workers began to enter Port Elizabeth seeking  employment, so then a number of so-called &quot;locations&quot; began to  be established on the outskirts of the White suburbs. Rosenthal (1970) has  defined locations as being:</p>
	  <p>&quot;<em>Large Native Reserves as well as small areas in  municipalities earmarked for residence by Africans.</em>&quot;</p>
	  <p>The pattern was first established in 1834 when the Colonial  Government made a grant of land to the London Missionary Society (LMS) to  provide a burial ground and residential area for &quot;Hottentots and other  coloured people who were members of the Church&quot; (Baines, 1989). This was  located at the crest of Hyman's Kloof, better known today as Russel Road.&nbsp; Other workers however chose to erect their  homes closer to their places of employment, or where a supply of potable water  was available. The major Black suburbs of that time were:</p>
	  <blockquote>
	    <p>Bethelsdorp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1803<br />
	      Fingo and Hottentot Location&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1830s<br />
	      LMS Outstation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1834<br />
	      Dassiekraal&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c1850<br />
	      Korsten&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1853<br />
	      Stranger's Location&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1855<br />
	      Gubbs Location&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1860<br />
	      Cooper's Kloof Location&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1877<br />
	      Reservoir Location&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1883</p>
	    </blockquote>
	  <p>With few exceptions these Black suburbs were informal in nature,  and residents there were forced to endure living conditions which contemporary  observers described as being squalid and open to exploitation by capitalist  landlords. Many Whites considered them to be unhealthy and petitions were  repeatedly organised demanding that they be removed to the outskirts of the  town. These requests were in direct opposition to the needs of the growing  commercial and industrial sectors which preferred to locate their labour  sources close to the harbour and the inner city area. These conflicting vested  interests created political tension within the Port Elizabeth Council which  were only resolved in 1885 when the Municipality adopted its first set of  markedly segregationist regulations.</p>
	  <p>As a result suburbs for the exclusive use of Black residents who  were not housed by employers, and who could not afford to purchase property,  were established on the outskirts of Port    Elizabeth. Most prominent amongst them were:</p>
	  <blockquote>
	    <p>Racecourse&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1896<br />
	      Walmer&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1896<br />
	      New Brighton&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1902</p>
	    </blockquote>
	  <p>In 1901 an outbreak of Bubonic plague struck the town. This was  the direct result of Argentinian fodder and horses being imported into South Africa by  the British military during the Anglo-Boer conflict. These cargos also carried  plague-infected rats, and although many members of the White and Coloured  communities were also affected, the Black population bore the brunt of the  Plague Health Regulations. In 1902 most of Port Elizabeth's old locations were  demolished (with the exception of Walmer), their resident's personal belongings  were arbitrarily destroyed, and restrictions were imposed upon inter-town  travel. Although these curbs might initially have been necessary, they were  only loosely applied to Whites, and were maintained upon the lives of Black  residents well after they were eased elsewhere, this in spite of repeated  complaints by the community's leaders.</p>
	  <p>Because New Brighton was located  relatively far from the centre, many families preferred to settle in Korsten  which, at the time, was beyond the Port    Elizabeth municipal boundary, but was still  substantially closer to town. Korsten also had a substantially more relaxed  attitude towards the brewing of illegal liquor, an activity to which many  families turned to as a strategy to balance their monthly household budgets.</p>
	  <p>During the colonial period therefore, the location system created  a pattern of residential segregation based upon perceived racial and economic  differences. However such divisions proved to be only partial, and it was only  the implementation of Apartheid Group Areas legislation after 1950 which  brought about a structural separation of Port    Elizabeth's residential areas. None-the-less it was  during this time that the seeds of the Apartheid City  were sown.</p>
	  <h5>POST-COLONIAL  SEGREGATION: 1910-1950</h5>
	  <p>By 1950 the population of New    Brighton had grown from 3,650 in 1911 to 35,000.  Almost all of it was Black. This polarisation was reinforced by the Native  Urban Areas Act of 1923 which required municipalities to establish separate  locations for their Black citizens, and made Black residents in &quot;White&quot;  areas subject to a permit system which Apartheid legislation subsequently  extended into the now-infamous dompas. The Native Land  and Trust Act of 1936 also precluded Blacks from purchasing land outside  designated areas. Existing suburbs, as well as new housing projects for Whites,  began to include racially restrictive clauses in their title deeds. In this way  most of Port Elizabeth's  western suburbs were reserved for exclusive White residence.</p>
	  <h5>APARTHEID  IDEOLOGY AND IMPLEMENTATION FROM 1950 TO DATE</h5>
	  <p>When the Nationalist Party came to power in 1948, the City of Port Elizabeth underwent  a number of extensive changes in its land use patterns through the  implementation of racially-motivated segregationist legislation. This included  the separation of citizens into so-called &quot;White&quot;, &quot;Bantu&quot;,  &quot;Coloured&quot; and &quot;Asian&quot; suburbs. Apartheid  legislation laid down that such areas should be set apart by buffer strips at  least 100m wide. These often coincided with existing physical barriers. As a  result, industrial areas such as Struandale, and natural features such as the Swartkops River and its escarpment, and pieces of  empty land such as Parsonsvlei, were used to define the parameters of the  city's suburbs.</p>
	  <p>It is important to note that Apartheid ideology did not view Black  workers as a permanent component of urban life, but held that, at some stage,  they would return of their own initiative and free will, to some rural  &quot;homeland&quot;. This is an attitude which had important political  repercussions in later years. Not only did it relate directly to the quality of  &quot;Bantu&quot; education, which in turn sparked off the Soweto student uprising  of 1976, but it also created residential conditions which will take many years,  and a substantial proportion of the national budget, to eradicate. Because of  this, Black access to land tenure, quality housing, infrastructure, social  amenities and economic opportunities was severely curtailed.</p>
	  <p>Black suburbs were developed on the remote outskirts of the city  making daily travel to the workplace expensive. Also, little retail and  business development was permitted within the townships (as they began to be  called), forcing residents to conduct the bulk of their shopping in the central  city area. The Apartheid   City thus did not merely  seek to beggar its Black citizens, it also entrenched in its fabric the &quot;company  store&quot; relationship existing between its Black suburbs and the  White-controlled CBD.</p>
	  <p>Matters did not change substantially after 1981 when the  Government acknowledged the permanent status of urban Black communities and put  in place an Ibhayi Town Council which would administer Port Elizabeth's Black suburbs as a separate  municipality. At this stage, the zoning of all industrial, retail and business  development within the boundaries of a neighbouring White Port Elizabeth  ensured that the two Municipalities did not share equally in the city's tax  base. This is one of the ways in which Port    Elizabeth's Black citizens continued to subsidise the  White community&rsquo;s expensive segregated lifestyle.</p>
	  <p>The process of Apartheid expropriation, relocation and residential  control had the effect of increasing New    Brighton's population from 35,000 persons in 1951 to  97,000 in 1960. As a result KwaZakele was established in 1956, and following  the demolitions of Salisbury Park, Fairview and South End in the late 1960s,  Zwide was declared in 1968 and Motherwell in 1982.</p>
	  <p>It also needs to be borne in mind that although the Nationalist  Government singlemindedly pursued a policy of racial segregation in the case of  White areas, it tended to ignore racial mixing and even intermarriage in other  communities. Thus even though new segregated suburbs such as Gelvandale,  Bethelsdorp and Bloemendal were established for exclusive Coloured occupation,  with Malabar being set aside for Indians, some areas such as Korsten which,  historically, had enjoyed a mixed population, retained much of their integrated  character well into the 1980s. Other communities, however, such as Fairview and South End,  saw their homes literally bulldozed to the ground and their lands given over  for exclusive White settlement.</p>
	  <h5>CONCLUSIONS</h5>
	  <p>It is clear that although the Group Areas Act was repealed in  1991, the component elements of Apartheid planning have been indelibly etched  into the urban fabric of Port    Elizabeth. It is probable that their effects will  continue to be felt for many years to come, and that their traces may never be  entirely expunged from the city's map.</p>
	  <p>In practical terms this means that the economic inequalities and  social injustices which Apartheid planning has imposed upon Port Elizabeth will not be done away through  a long term, liberal, free-market exchange of land. Current experience has  indicated that, despite the removal of Group Areas limitations, most middle and  upper income Black families are trapped in their old suburbs through an  inability to dispose of their properties without suffering massive financial  losses. The plight of lower income Black families is even worse. It is obvious  therefore that this deadlock can only be broken through an interventionist  policy of stringent land and price controls orchestrated through a central  government committed to strong democracy, community empowerment and the generation  of wealth. This is not a philosophy likely to find favour with either White  Liberals or the country's Neo-Democrats who have both benefited extensively  from the interventionist policies imposed upon a voteless majority by a  minority government obsessed with totalitarian notions of race, ethnicity and  skin pigmentation. It is probable that the granite edifice of discrimination  will not be dismantled by using rubber mallets.</p>
	  <h5>POSTSCRIPT</h5>
	  <p>This paper was prepared in about 1990 at a time when I was part of  the ANC&rsquo;s One City Initiatives in Port    Elizabeth, and no coherent history of its Apartheid  origins was available. To the best of my knowledge it has never been published,  although I delivered any number of lectures and public talks on the subject  when I was still living in the Eastern    Cape. Now that it has been re-discovered, I am sure  that I will be able to find a home for it in some journal. Please watch this  space.</p>
