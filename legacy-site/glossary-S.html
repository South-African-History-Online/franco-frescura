		<p> SADDLE BARS. The small iron bars reinforcing leaded  glazing in casement windows. (Afrikaans: dwarsroeisteun).</p>
		<p> SADDLE-PIECE. The junction of a ridge with the main  roof cover. See also RIDGE CAPPING. (Afrikaans: nokstuk).</p>
		<p> SALA. (Indian). A type of shrine or a  miniature version of a shrine that is rectangular in plan and has a  barrel-vaulted, or perhaps, more properly, a &ldquo;barrel-shaped&rdquo; roof. It  may serve as the crowning element of a tower or as a decorative motif repeated  on the stories of the superstructure of a south Indian-style temple, as well as  in other architectural and decorative contexts. Also an enclosure or cloister.</p>
		<p> SAMGHARAMA. (Indian). A monastery.</p>
		<p> SAN. Name given by the Khoikhoi to the  indigenous group of southern African migrant hunter-gatherers more commonly  known as the Bushmen. In view of the pejorative undertones of the latter  word, anthropologists and archaeologists have opted, in more recent times, for  the former which is believed to signify &quot;a person without domestic  stock&quot;.</p>
		<p> SANDHARA. (Indian). A type of temple characterized  by an enclosed passageway for circumambulation.</p>
		<p> SAPLING. A thin pliable length of young timber,  usually less than 20mm in diameter. (Afrikaans: jong hout).</p>

		<p>		  SCISSORS TRUSS. A simple truss formed of four main  members. Two are rafters from wall-plate to ridge; the other two extend from  the rafter at wall-plate level to the middle of the opposite rafter. These two  members intersect at the middle of the span, giving a scissors-like appearance  to the truss. (Afrikaans: skerkap).</p>
		<p> SCOTIA. A concave moulding, also called a Rising  Hollow or a Trochilus. (Afrikaans: trogilus).</p>
		<p> SCUD. Twisted rope of straw used in  conjunction with spars for fixing thatch. (Afrikaans: strooitou).</p>

		<p> SETT. See under COURSE (Thatching).</p>

In south Indian  architecture, the term does not refer to the entire superstructure but only to  the globular or domed roof of the uppermost element in the superstructure. It  is topped by a finial known as a stupi and is supported by the griva,  or neck.</p>
		<p> SHINGLE. Wooden roof tile, often made from cleft  oak, cedar or teak. (Afrikaans: dakspaan).</p>
		<p> SHONA. A group of people indigenous to  Zimbabwe, although in the past their lands are thought to have included large  areas of the northern Transvaal. They are more correctly known as the maShona  and their language is referred to as chiShona. The Venda are also  currently believed to be part of a larger Shona grouping.</p>
		<p> SHORE. Called a shoar; temporary timber  buttress used to support buildings undergoing structural maintenance.  (Afrikaans: skoor).</p>

		<p> SIVA. (Indian). &quot;Auspicious.&quot;  One of the principal Hindu gods; god of destruction. He may appear in many  forms, both peaceful and angry. His characteristic vahana is the bull  Nandi; he has many attributes, but one of the most important is the trident. In  temples dedicated to him, a linga is usually placed as the central  votive object in the shrine rather than an anthropomorphic image of him.</p>
		<p> SKARNIER. (Afrikaans). See under HINGE.</p>
		<p> SKERKAP. (Afrikaans). See under SCISSORS TRUSS.</p>
		<p> SKERM. Dutch term for the wind screens used by  early farmers in the Cape. It is probable that these were adapted from similar  mat structures used by the indigenous KhoiSan.</p>

		<p> SOD BRICK  CONSTRUCTION. A  method of wall construction used in some parts of southern Africa whereby the  building blocks are obtained by cutting up a field of turf into squares  approximately 300x450mm. The sods are then lifted up by means of a spade with  the clay particles being held together by the vegetation. After the sods have  been laid into a vertical wall, the continued growth of the grass is often  encouraged in order to bind the individual parts into one larger and homogenous  mass.

		<p> SOTHO. A group indigenous to the interior of  southern Africa who today are generally regarded by anthropologists as  belonging to a larger Sotho/Tswana identity. The current use of this term  refers to the southern Sotho of Lesotho and the southern highveld whose  national homogeneity is of relatively short standing, being the result of the  events of Difaqane and the subsequent colonialisation of the region. Their  language is known as seSotho.</p>
		<p> SOTHO ARCHITECTURE. The architecture of the southern  highveld and Lesotho has undergone extensive changes in recent years. At one  time this region was noted for its dwellings with extended, snout-like  entrances but since the 1920s these have undergone widespread change and today  the thatched cone on cylinder and the lean-to highveld house rival each other  for supremacy. The latter dwelling often displays a richly decorated facade.</p>
		<p> SOUTH NDEBELE  ARCHITECTURE. The  South Ndebele inhabit a region of the Transvaal located north-east of Pretoria,  between Middelburg and Groblersdal. Historically their architecture has been  based upon that of their northern neighbours and political allies, the Pedi.  Their dwellings were circular with a verandah running about the external  perimeter but in recent years these have largely been superseded by square  plan, lean-to, parapet structures, much like those found on the southern  highveld. Since the 1940s their women have developed a unique style of  polychromatic wall art which draws deeply from the patterns of urban life they  have observed in the towns about them.</p>
		<p> SPANDREL. A roughly triangular space between the  arch of a doorway and the rectangle formed by the outer mouldings surrounding  it. (Afrikaans: hoekvlakvormig).</p>
		<p> SPAR. A split length of hazel, pointed at both  ends and twisted in the middle, using for fixing liggers, cross-rods and scuds.  Also known as a spit.</p>
		<p> SPAR HOOK. Thatcher's tool used for splitting and  pointing hazel spars. (Afrikaans: deksparhak).</p>
		<p> SPAZA. (Urban slang). Literally translates to &ldquo;not  quite&rdquo; or &ldquo;not the real thing&rdquo;, as in &ldquo;spaza shop&rdquo;, or &ldquo;not  a conventional shop&rdquo;.</p>
		<p> SPIL. (Afrikaans). Also referred to as Trap.  See under NEWEL.</p>

In Jainism  and Buddhism, an architectural term denoting a dome-shaped or rounded structure  that contains the relic of a Buddha, a great teacher, or some other honored  individual, and is thus, generally considered to be a type of sepulchral  monument.
