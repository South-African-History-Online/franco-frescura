        <h5>INTRODUCTION</h5>
        <p>European missionaries to southern Africa  during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries played a strangely ambiguous role  in the history and affairs of the region. On the one hand they were driven by a  strong desire to genuinely serve humanity and bring about material and social  changes which would improve its quality of life. On the other hand they were  possessed of a moral self-righteousness which led them to make hasty and  uninformed judgments upon indigenous mores, norms and values they were scarcely  equipped to understand. The first manifested itself in an involvement in local  agriculture, irrigation and technology which, being environmental and hence  independent of larger cultural issues, found a small measure of acceptance in rural  society. The second sought to impose an alien morality and work ethos upon the  local people without realising that these undermined their most basic social  and cultural tenets and were therefore largely resisted. The dichotomy of this  approach was not something which found separate expression in different  individuals but was often incorporated within the same person. Casalis wrote at  Thaba Bosiu, Lesotho, in about 1833, that:</p>
        <p>&quot;... <em>we said that, wishing to provide  entirely for our own subsistence, we must have a site where we could build  houses and cultivate the ground according to our own ideas and habits. Our  buildings and plantations would also serve as a model for the Basutos, whom we  regretted to see dwelling in huts, and living in a manner so precarious and so  little worthy of the intelligence with which they were gifted</em>.&quot; (1889)</p>
        <p>It is not for nothing that the statue of Livingstone in Edinburgh represents the  missionary-traveller with a Bible in one hand and the other resting upon an axe  (Warneck 1888). Ironically enough, in the long run it was found that changes  wrought by missionaries at a practical and economic level did more to further  their spiritual cause than any amount of moralistic sermonising ever did from  the pulpit. Local acceptance of early missionaries in the eastern Cape hinged more upon their  technological ability to introduce furrow irrigation into an otherwise  drought-stricken land than upon their Christian teachings (Williams 1959). This  was also borne out by the experiences of Moffatt in the northern Cape.</p>
        <p>The ability of missionaries to make converts and hold them on  their stations also seems to have been somewhat in doubt. Etherington (1977)  stated that only 12% of people on mission settlements were there for &quot;<em>spiritual</em>&quot;  reasons. The majority sought either material advantage or psychological  security. Also, although some groups such as the Basotho and the Tswana openly  welcomed missionaries, others like the Pedi, the Zulu and the Pondo vehemently  rejected their presence as a matter of national policy. Despite Campbell's claim that:</p>
        <p>&quot;<em>Missionary stations are surrounded  by moral atmospheres, or have a moral and civilizing influence to a  considerable distance around, beyond which it is extremely hazardous for white  men to go.</em>&quot;  (1815)</p>
        <p>they had strong objections to a missionary presence and often took  appropriate action. Whole populations moved away from stations; individuals  suspected of Christian leanings were administered magic and emetics; and  converts were ostracized and quarantined to missionary settlements, thus being  effectively purged from the group's polity and its social functions. Despite  the continuing spread of a missionary presence into southern Africa  during the 19th Century, by the time of the Anglo-Zulu conflict of  1879 very few converts had been won over to Christianity (Etherington 1977).</p>
