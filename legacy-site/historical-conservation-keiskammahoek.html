	  <h5 align="left">KEISKAMMAHOEK - 
	    The Conservation Study of a Small   Settler Village</h5>
	  <p align="left">Franco  Frescura</p>
	  <h5>HISTORICAL  BACKGROUND</h5>
	  <p>Keiskammahoek  is a small settler village in the foothills of the Amatola  Mountains, located some 50km from King  William's Town, at the confluence of the Gxulu and Keiskamma Rivers.  It has long been known to local inhabitants as a sheltered and fertile spot  and, despite being located in a drought-ridden region, it has never lacked for  water. The indigenous name for the area is Qobo Qobo which, loosely translated,  means &quot;a fragile thing&quot; but, since 1847, it has also been  known as Keiskammahoek. This name, derived from Dutch and Khoikhoi roots means,  quite literally, &quot;corner of shining waters&quot;.</p>
	  <p>The  area was first settled by whites during the 1846-7 border conflict, more  popularly known as The War of the Axe, when a British military outpost,  generally referred to at the time as &quot;<em>the camp in the mountains</em>&quot;,  was established there. At the end of hostilities the camp was abandoned by the  military, who were replaced soon after, in 1849, by a Scottish missionary, the  Rev Robert Niven. He chose it as the site for his mission station, Uniondale, his aim being to preach the gospel among  Mfengu and Xhosa clans already residing in the area. The first buildings  consisted of little more than a few wattle and daub huts. However this mission  was short-lived as the Rev. Niven and his family were forced to flee when their  home was burnt down upon the outbreak of further hostilities in 1850. </p>
	  <p align="center"><img src="images/keis/picture-04.jpg" width="200" height="284" /></p>
	  <p>In  1851, as a direct result of this war, the British re-established a tented camp  at Keiskammahoek under the command of Colonel Henry Somerset. In April 1852 a  body of Royal Engineers joined the contingent and began the erection of a  fortified tower. This was completed in 1855 and named Castle Eyre after Colonel  John Eyre of the 73rd Royal Highlanders. In March 1853 the Cape Colonial  Government declared the area immediately surrounding Castle Eyre a Royal  Crown Reserve with the expressed intent of establishing a permanent village  on this site. The first settlers began building homes at Keiskammahoek soon  after the end of hostilities in 1853. During the next decade the village's  white population rapidly expanded its numbers with the settlement of German  legionaries and their families who immigrated to South Africa during 1857 and 1858.  A further influx of German settlers brought more families to the region in  1876-7. In about 1858 a Lutheran church was built in the village but this  structure proved unsatisfactory and was replaced by a more permanent building  during 1877. Several other churches were also built in Keiskammahoek, the  Gilead Chapel, consecrated in 1872, being amongst the most notable.</p>
	  <h5>THE  CONSERVATION STUDY</h5>
	  <p>Research  into the architectural heritage of Keiskammahoek was initiated in 1984 as a  result of work being conducted at that time towards the development of a Cultural Museum  complex for the Ciskei.  The project sought to break new ground in the field of museum development in  this country in that one of its prime objectives was the generation of economic  development in the region. As such the tourist component became incidental to  the provision of a wider educational facility which could be used to supplement  existing school functions. It thus sought to work within the parameters of the  area's cultural and economic realities.</p>
	  <p>It was  found that Keiskammahoek served a large rural community with extensive  unemployment problems; that it was endowed with a service infrastructure; that  it badly needed additional educational facilities; and thus that it offered the  best potential for new economic development. As a result it was decided that  the larger objectives of the brief would be best served by weaving the  functions of a Cultural Centre within the existing social and physical fabric of  the village. The concept implied that the settlement as a whole would be  subjected to a process of revalidation and conservation, much as one would  treat a single building of historical importance. This had a number of major  advantages:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>It  would make full use of an existing service reticulation and human  infrastructure without expensive extension being requiring.</li>
	    <li>The  use of existing buildings within the village for such functions as craft  manufacture, craft marketing and cultural activities would free part of the  budget for other more pressing uses such as the preservation of more threatened  domestic structures.</li>
	    <li>The  presence of certain facilities within the village would make the restoration of  its historic architectural character a more attractive economic proposition,  thus becoming potential tourist draw-cards in their own right.</li>
	    <li>The  fragmentation of the project functions would allow potentially unfeasible or  unsuccessful elements to be identified more rapidly thus allowing for immediate  remedial action to be taken.</li>
	    <li>The  same fragmentation would allow a more extensive and imaginative use of existing  vacant or under-utilised facilities within the village.</li>
	    <li>The  presence of tourist facilities would provide the impetus for fringe economic  activities. </li>
	    <li>In  the process it would create opportunities for local employment.</li>
      </ul>
	  <h5>THE  SURVEY</h5>
	  <p>Keiskammahoek  consists of some 125 structures of which 48 were identified as being of either  architectural or historical merit. This means that a relatively high proportion  of the building stock is worthy of preservation and restoration. Their  concentration and state of preservation however makes this village an important  enclave of colonial architecture. Most of these buildings line the main street,  forming a group with a distinct architectural character. A further cluster was  also identified around the old mill. A broad range of building types was noted  including seven churches, a library, a hotel, shops and a village hall, but the  majority are single storied houses ranging from a small pioneer cottage to  substantial villas. Their ages were found to vary from late 19th century to the  1920s. Thus a broad representative spectrum of historical architecture may be  found within the village.</p>
	  <h5>PROBLEMS  WITH THE EXISTING FABRIC</h5>
	  <p>Some  buildings, notably the churches, library and village hall, appeared to be  disused or under-utilised, and a process of conservation and revalidation would  require that new and compatible uses be found for these. Some buildings  suffered from structural decay and such elements as verandahs and decorative  trims required urgent attention. Other structures were also found to have  undergone inappropriate alteration or unsympathetic additions and were thus in  need of specialist attention.</p>
	  <h5>POTENTIAL  FOR CONSERVATION</h5>
	  <p>Although  many historically important buildings required a degree of restoration, this  was not perceived to be unduly expensive, most structures being of a relatively  small scale. Particular attention should also be paid to the restoration of the  physical environment, especially in such areas as garden walls, trees and  plantings.</p>
	  <p>In  view of the fact that most structures are currently used for domestic purposes,  a policy of land use and building controls should ensure that the dwellings  continue to serve their original functions. The potential re-use of larger  structures such as the village hall, the library and the various churches,  should also be investigated. Some could operate as specialist museums, while  others may be revalidated to serve as craft centres. Areas which require  special attention include:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>The  remains of the old gun redoubt which would make an excellent museum of local  military history.</li>
	    <li>The  old cemetery which, with a minimum of restoration, could become an important  attraction for tourists and historians alike.</li>
	    <li>The  old village hall which could be revalidated to function as a local history  museum.</li>
	    <li>The  old farmhouse next to the Nettleton   Bridge which could make  an excellent open-air farm museum. </li>
	    <li>Some  difficulty may be experienced in restoring the present hotel. It should  nonetheless be upgraded to serve as a base for tourists and day-trippers.</li>
	    <li>The  old mill, including the outbuildings around it, whose present functions could  be extended to include the manufacture of yellowwood furniture, thus providing  an important tourist attraction as well as fulfilling a viable economic  function.</li>
	    <li>The  upgrading and restoration of the village as a whole along its main street would  provide a charming context for the above attractions.</li>
      </ul>
	  <h5>IRRELEVANT  AND INTRUSIVE BUILDINGS</h5>
	  <p>These  may be classified into two categories, the first being those buildings situated  away from the historical core and therefore outside the concerns of this  survey. The second group consists of those within the core which will need some  form of architectural treatment in order to bring them into harmony with their  older neighbours. The garage located on the main street is a prime example.  This need not necessarily become an expensive exercise.</p>
	  <h5>NATURAL  LANDSCAPE</h5>
	  <p>The  village's existing natural landscaping, principally the lines of trees along  the roads, add considerably to its character. This should be preserved and  extended. The water canals should also be preserved and maintained. Landscaping  should be undertaken to enhance new building developments and diminish the  impact of environmentally intrusive structures.</p>
	  <h5>LARGER  CONSERVATION CONCERNS</h5>
	  <p>Keiskammahoek  is beautifully situated in attractive natural surroundings, and thus has  enormous potential as an overnight stop for tourists. It is proposed that the  village be included into an Eastern Province and Ciskei  tour package, beginning in Port Elizabeth and  ending in East London, which could be added to  the popular Garden Route.  A rich itinerary could thus be arranged. However it is important that a tarred  road linking Keiskammahoek to the King William's Town-Alice road be developed  if this route is to be used by coaches.</p>
	  <p>The  question of future developments in the village as a growth point needs to be  carefully studied, as large and unsympathetic building activity could easily  destroy its character and void any restoration work done. The large- scale  implementation of small and insensitive changes would similarly affect its  fabric.</p>
	  <p>The  socio-economic implications of a restoration programme are also in need of  serious consideration. The training of local building craftsmen, for example,  will create a labour force able to undertake restoration work, thus upgrading  local building skills and creating new job opportunities.</p>
	  <h5>RECOMMENDATIONS</h5>
	  <p>The village of Keiskammahoek has a rich architectural  and historical heritage which has received little publicity to date. Its  potential for tourism should therefore be recognised and a programme of  restoration and preservation embarked upon as a matter of urgency. To this end,  a more detailed inspection of each building identified during the course of  this survey should be undertaken, principally for budgeting purposes. The town  and its environment should also be declared a special conservation area  so that all decisions regarding its fabric may be made by a co-ordinating body  of experts and local citizens.</p>
	  <p>A  comprehensive study should also be commissioned to investigate the  socio-economic implications and possibilities of a restoration programme. A  major element of such a brief must be the investigation and formulation of  future land use strategies for the village as a whole. In view of the various  activities which may, at some future date, center upon this area, it is  important that a planning strategy be developed in order to provide the various  bodies with a larger framework within which a number of different activities  may take place.</p>
	  <h5>CONCLUSIONS</h5>
	  <p>Shortly  before Ciskeian independence the village   of Keiskammahoek was on  the point of being declared a national monument. However, since its  incorporation under this new regional authority, many of its buildings have  been sold to the government who, lacking sufficient data and architectural  expertise, has allowed them to deteriorate. In many cases dwellings have been  let to civil servants, mostly policemen, who have vandalised the structures  extensively. As a result the village's buildings are undergoing extensive  changes almost daily.&nbsp; Timber sash  windows are being replaced with steel-framed units, fretted timber fascias with  asbestos panels and yellowwood floors with cement screed. Sadly this once  picturesque settlement seems to be destined for the same fate which has  befallen so many of southern Africa's small  towns and villages, where insensitive modernisation has created faceless  centres devoid of architectural character. However, before the  conservative-minded reader passes judgment upon its new owners, let him  remember that the plunder of Keiskammahoek was begun by its white inhabitants  before they left in 1981. The library's stock of books was distributed among  the locals, the hotel's antique collection sold to affluent socialites from Cape Town and Johannesburg,  the gravestones plundered by curio hunters and the cast-iron trims removed to  private residences in King William's Town. The only reason why the military  sabres remain atop the village hall and HMS Thunderer's cannon has kept its  place before the village school is because the former were found to be fakes  and the latter proved too heavy to be moved.</p>
	  <h5>ADDENDUM</h5>
	  <p>The final  chapter of this research saga was written in February 1985 when, contrary to  the recommendations of its appointed experts, the Ciskei National Tourist  Office (CINTO), decided to locate the museum project at Thaba ka Ndoda, a site  remote from all population centres and with little chance of economic  development. In view of the threat under which the village  of Keiskammahoek now found itself,  architectural students from the University   of Port Elizabeth  descended upon this centre in April and May 1985 and measured up 39 structures  considered to be of major architectural and historical importance. This was not  done out of any sense of altruism but rather in the knowledge that most of  these buildings were in the process of being lost through neglect and careless  alteration and should be recorded for the sake of future generations. Sadly it  must now be reported that since that time the old gun redoubt has also  undergone extensive and wanton vandalisation at the hands of the Ciskei Police,  its stone walls breached and its yellowwood floors burnt as firewood. Also, in  about 1993, the Drill Hall was burnt down by vagrants, Ballantine&rsquo;s Mill was  vandalized and partly destroyed by fire, probably to mask the fact that much of  its old stock of yellowwood had been stolen, and most of the historically  relevant domestic structures had been altered beyond restoration.</p>
