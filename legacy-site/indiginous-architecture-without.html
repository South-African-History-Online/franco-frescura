        <h5 align="left">ARCHITECTURE WITHOUT ARCHITECTS</h5>
        <p align="left">Franco Frescura</p>
        <p>Designers have long been fascinated by the concept of an  architecture without architects&quot;. Ever since 1753 when Marc-Antoine  Laugier proclaimed that &quot;All the splendours of architecture ever  conceived have been modelled on the little rustic hut&quot;, the profession  has attempted to discover the secret of how a layman could take a variety of  common materials and convert them to buildings of consistently high quality -  all without the benefit of having first completed six years of university  study. The ensuing search has not been fruitless and the publications on  vernacular architecture by Paul Oliver, Rene Gardi, Labelle Prussin, Ronald  Brunskill and our own James Walton stand as important markers in the study of  man and his built culture. Today a generation of young graduates, sensitised by  the writings of Rapoport and Papanek, have come to realise that a designer is  an expensive and overrated commodity in a developing economy. As a result of  their work, we are now witnessing a growing diversification of our professional  activities. It is true that some architects are still treading the conventional  and well-worn path to success through a partnership in the larger and more  commercial practices. Many others however are turning their skills to the  resolution of such sensitive issues as community design, cultural conservation  and environmental control.</p>
        <p>These young designers are also reshaping the way in which  architecture will be practiced in this country well into the next century. By  entering into loosely organised multi-disciplinary cooperatives with a variety  of skills available to them, they feel better equipped to handle the social  issues surrounding architecture, which older members of the profession have  ignored for too many years. Although they have not ceased their work as  designers, they are no doubt mindful of Victor Papanek's warning, made in 1974,  when he stated that:</p>
        <p>&quot;<em>In an environment that is screwed up  visually, physically and chemically, the best and simplest thing that  architects ... could do for humanity would be to stop working entirely.</em>&quot;</p>
        <p>More importantly many of these young professionals have retained  their links with the universities and their published research is beginning to  make an impact on the public perception of our own built environment.  Inevitably some of these researchers have also been led to question the tenets  established by earlier generations of academics. The result has been a more  rigorous and critical approach to research, which has followed a strong  revisionist line, and has thus spared few sainted bovines.</p>
        <p>This revisionism comes at a time when South Africans as a whole  are taking stock of their history over the past five hundred years and are  reassessing their options for the future. Much of our previous architectural  history was written from a strongly eurocentric standpoint and often reflected  views best suited to a colonial era. Fortunately these find little relevance,  or indeed sympathy, in the new social order which is emerging, slowly and ever  so painfully, in our country today.</p>
        <p>This edition of Architecture SA is dedicated to the artifacts of a  society without specialist designers. True to form very few of the contributors  practice architecture in the conventional sense of the word, and some are not  architects at all. The subjects they have covered include a wide range of  interests, spanning from headrests and burglar bars through to Cape Dutch  and Voortrekker architectures. It is not expected that this issue will meet  with universal acclaim. Vernacular architecture is, after all, something of an  acquired taste. However it does reflect some aspects of our local built culture  which normally fail to find a place in this country's building journals. I, for  one, am grateful to have been given the opportunity of redressing this  imbalance to a small degree.</p>
        <h5>POSTSCRIPT</h5>
        <p>In 1989 I was invited to be the guest editor for an issue of  Architecture SA on the subject of &ldquo;Architecture Without Architects&rdquo;.  (Architecture SA: Guest Editor, July/August 1989. Special  edition on Architecture Without Architects)</p>
