        <h5 align="left">THE PROCESSES OF RURAL ARCHITECTURE</h5>
        <p align="left">Franco Frescura</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Since 1727 when Kolbe published his treatise on the Khoikhoi  (Kolbe 1727), much has been written on the subject of the indigenous people of  southern Africa. A large proportion of this took place during the nineteenth  century when travellers, hunters, traders and missionaries initially  transversed this region. Understandably the background of these early scribes  was anything but architectural and, in consequence, only a small proportion of  their accounts was devoted to the description of the built environment. Also,  being men of their time, the majority tended to view the local architecture in  the context of their own experience and cultural values; few, it seems,  considered it from the point of view of indigenous builders, taking into  account materials available, physical environment and the socio-economic  factors which established the parameters limiting their options. None perceived  it to be possessed of a recognizable idiom of land settlement and studied it  accordingly. This ground was left for anthropologists to explore from the 1920s  onwards (Schapera 1935, Junod 1962, Monnig 1967, and others).</p>
        <p>Today it is generally recognized that the architecture of any  given society cannot be studied in isolation of its socio- economic realities  (Oliver 1968). Yet, although there has been a noticeable rise in the number of  specialized studies published in recent years on the subject of rural  architecture, with a few notable exceptions most still persist in viewing the  subject through a filter of western cultural conditioning (Knuffel 1973). It is  true that the processes which generate rural architecture are often discussed  but somehow the connections between process and product are seldom made, and  then, at best, in a tenuous manner.</p>
        <h5>PROCESS  AND PRODUCT</h5>
        <p>For the purpose of this exercise, the word &quot;process&quot;  has been defined as the physical means employed in the production of an  artifact, and includes the historical, social and economic circumstances  surrounding such an event; &quot;product&quot; therefore refers to that  finished artifact. A typical example might be the creative output of an artist.  Students of the artistic &quot;process&quot; would consider, amongst  other things, such contextual factors as social background, economic standing,  psychological make-up and the nature of the subject matter; students of &quot;product&quot;,  on the other hand, might limit their studies to the artist's final output, the  aesthetic properties of the pictorial rendition on canvas.</p>
        <p>It is obvious that an analysis which ignores either process or  product, favouring the one ahead of the other, runs the peril of being shallow  and mono-dimensional. For this reason this study does not limit itself to  either method of analysis but takes a broad view of the subject. It does  however attempt to break he chicken-and-egg cycle which has arisen in the field  of the arts, centering on the question of precedence between &quot;function&quot;  and &quot;aesthetics&quot;. In the context of current southern African  society this argument is not only of academic interest, for its implications  extend to the very heart of racist political ideologies and question the basis  of white preconceptions of black regional &quot;ethnicity&quot;.</p>
        <h5>REGIONAL  STEREOTYPES</h5>
        <p>Although events of the Difaqane, between 1822 and 1836, did not  play a significant role in the history and development of rural architecture in  southern Africa, they are useful for they represent the definite and  recognizable end of an epoch in the history of the region. It was a time of  irrational warfare, of scattering of large communities, of famine and of  hunger. It was also a time which saw the emergence of great leaders and the  coalescing of new nations. Naturally enough therefore, the Difaqane also marks  the beginning of a new era which, because of the presence of white observers,  has been extensively documented virtually from its onset. This means that,  during that time, missionaries and other travelers were witness to the  displacement of entire clans and the resettlement of whole areas. Their  accounts also made frequent reference to the architecture of the people  concerned (Broadbent 1865, and others). This has given architectural historians  a bench-mark to trace the changes in the local built environment which took  place from one generation to the next. As, in many cases, these were  accompanied by descriptions of the physical environment, it becomes possible to  compare how changes in the local environment manifested themselves in the  development of new architectures and methods of construction.</p>
        <p>The inhabitants of the Lesotho region are a good case in point.  Before the 1830s this group consisted of a number of Nguni, Sotho and  Tswana-speaking clans, and thus could not lay claim to a collective &quot;cultural&quot;  identity (Lye and Murray 1980). It is only since the 1930s that anthropologists  began describing them under the collective noun of &quot;South Sotho&quot;.  The writings of Casalis in 1833, Widdicombe in 1895 and James Walton in 1956  reveal that, after the Difaqane, their domestic architecture underwent at least  three major changes over a period of some 120 years. Each change, in its own  time and its own turn, was described by observers as being stereotypically  &quot;Basotho&quot;, leading to the creation, in white literature at any  rate, of a &quot;Sotho&quot; architectural style. It must be obvious  however that, under these circumstances, the concept of a Sotho stereotype must  be erroneous, not only because in this particular case it can be proven that  the form of the Sotho dwelling changed over a period of some six generations,  but also because these &quot;stylistic&quot; changes are the result of  physical and material fluctuations rather than conscious aesthetic and cultural  choices.</p>
        <p>A second case study is that of the Matabele, an Nguni-speaking  group who emigrated from northern Natal in 1822. For the next 15 years they  migrated through the southern African hinterland, making three stops before  ending their journey in western Zimbabwe, where their descendants reside to the  present day. Although their travels took them through four different climatic  and vegetation zones, and their Nguni customs must have been considerably  diluted through the absorption of Sotho-Tswana groups they encountered on the  way, they nonetheless clung steadfastly to their &quot;Zulu&quot; dress,  weapons and architecture. This was done for reasons of political ideology, at a  time when they were attempting to establish a separate and competing &quot;Zulu&quot;  identity in the southern African interior. Once the political reasons for  maintaining their architecture had been superceded, they abandoned their former  building traditions and adopted those of their Shona neighbours in Zimbabwe.</p>
        <p>These cases make it possible to short-circuit the argument between  function and aesthetics and arrive at two broad principles of application:</p>
        <ol type="a">
          <li>in  those cases where architecture does not become a conscious statement of  identity or political ideology, then process will precede product</li>
          <li>in  those cases where historical stereotypes are&nbsp;  maintained artificially, once the reasons for their continuance are  removed, or become irrelevant, they will be amended by pragmatic practice and  the primacy of process over product will be re-established.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>By extension therefore, it may be concluded that the concept of  regional architectures based upon pragmatic considerations of materials  available and prevailing physical environment precedes the development or  emergence of an architectural stereotype linked to the idea of an &quot;ethnic&quot;  or &quot;cultural&quot; identity. This is not to deny the possibility  that building stereotypes may exist as part of a group's cultural identity; it  is merely to state that such stereotypes are not constants and that they too  are subject to change from one generation to the next.</p>
        <p>THE  ARCHITECTURE OF PRAGMATISM</p>
        <p>The provision of indigenous shelter in southern Africa has always  been a pragmatic and highly functional process. For a number of historical  reasons, the region's rural economy never entered an industrial stage and  although settlements of ten to twenty thousand persons were not uncommon (Holub  1881), these areas never achieved a high degree of urbanization as it is  conventionally understood by western society. In fact mobility of domicile has  always been a desirable quality of rural settlement for economic (Burchell  1953) and mystical (Schapera 1930) as well as political reasons (Peires 1981).  Thus although certain sites are known to have been inhabited over a period of  many centuries (Fouche 1937), southern African rural dwellers do not appear to  have shared their European counterparts' preoccupation with permanence. This is  supported, to a large extent, by indigenous concepts of land ownership and  tenure, which differ radically from the European example, being based upon a  system of common ownership under the stewardship of a patriarchal or clan head  (Davenport and Hunt 1974).</p>
        <p>This need to maintain mobility of settlement has made rural  architecture directly dependant upon its immediate surrounds for its building  materials. It is true that at least one group, the Khoikhoi, are known to have  made use of dismountable and highly portable dwellings (Burchell 1953). It is  also true that certain Nguni groups are known to have transported their  dwellings, ready-made, over relatively short distances (Kuper 1963). However  the former are a distinct exception to the general rule for the region, while  the latter are not reputed to have transplanted themselves in this manner over  any great distance. For the remainder, however, their architecture has to  derive its materials in the immediate vicinity of a settlement as a matter of necessity.</p>
        <p>Because it views the natural environment as a ready quarry,  obtaining the sticks, the stones, the clay and the grass required from the  surrounding countryside, it is a highly functional kind of architecture, using  materials according to their natural properties. This has affected, to a large  extent, the resolution of some details of construction, such as the treatment  of the roof apex and the connection between wall and roof at the eaves. By  implication this has also influenced the dwelling form itself, giving rise to  specialized details which, in time, have become incorporated into a larger  regional stereotype.</p>
        <p>During the course of current field-work it was found that the  creation of stereotypes was based primarily upon the perception of dwelling  form rather than upon a detailed understanding of structure. This meant that  the outward textures of a dwelling, derived from the use of different building  materials, were important contributors to the regional identity of a built  environment as were its architectural forms. At the same time it was also  discovered that rural communities often had knowledge of the technological  processes involved in the construction of dwellings in neighbouring regions.  Significantly these were not perceived to be differences in building traditions  but variations upon the same theme.</p>
        <p>The relationship existing between materials, environment and  dwelling form is perhaps nowhere better illustrated than in the squatter camps  which are located in the vicinity of some of southern Africa's major urban  centres. During the course of a previous study which included communities in  the western Cape, the Durban-Pietermaritzburg area, Thaba 'Nchu and the  Winterveld near Pretoria (Frescura 1982), it was found that increased  competition for building resources had brought about a uniform style of  architecture.&nbsp; Interestingly, it was  noted that although the building technologies used were an adaptation of the  region's rural know-how, in many cases the builders were not newly migrated  rural workers but were second and third generation urban residents who had not  as yet been catered for in official housing programs (Haarhoff 1982).</p>
        <p>This was supported indirectly by data obtained in the western Cape  which indicated showed that a virtual absence of natural found building  materials in this region had forced squatters of both urban and rural origins  to seek the necessary materials from the consumer society about them. As a  result they used its cast-offs to create dwellings from sheets of corrugated iron,  wall and ceiling insulation from newspapers and printer's waste, door mats from  milk trays, and gardens from empty food cans. Despite obvious differences in  their socio-economic backgrounds, both urban and rural groups had come to the  same pragmatic conclusions regarding their habitat and shared in a common  dwelling form built out of a common technology forced upon them by local  conditions. The degree of inventiveness shown by squatter communities in taking  common objects out of their familiar context and adapting them to fulfill new  functions, successfully demonstrated a common ability to grasp the fundamental  nature and properties of materials when faced with the economic realities of  their situation (Frescura 1982).</p>
        <h5>THE  ECOLOGY OF THE RURAL DWELLING</h5>
        <p>One of the attractions of vernacular architecture lies in its  seeming ability seemingly to merge with, and become part of, its immediate  environs. Whilst such aesthetics are undoubtedly part of its charms, they are  also an outward manifestation of yet another important aspect of the rural  habitat: the fact that the dwelling is part of a delicate environmental balance  at the level of both an individual unit, and at the larger scale of regional  settlement.</p>
        <p>Historically the southern African rural dwelling has been built  predominantly out of saplings or timbers, clay, grass and cow dung. Depending  upon the region, stone rubble and shales have also been used in wall  construction while natural lime has been found to be a good soil stabilizer.  However, being natural materials, these have also tended to provide a home to a  variety of insects, lizards and other small fauna which can subsist alongside,  or even in spite of, people. This has led to the dwelling developing an  internal balance of its own, with the family and their activities providing a  check to the infestation of their environment. A good example is the building  of a fire in the dwelling for both heating and cooking functions. This is  generally the case for both cooking and sleeping units although, quite often in  the latter's case, it is only the hot coals which are brought in within a small  brazier. The smoke from these fires is allowed to rise and percolate through  the thatched grass roof, thus effectively fumigating it and discouraging vermin  infestation. To a certain extent this process must also be assumed to be  effective where clay walls are concerned. Should, for any reason, the owners of  a dwelling decide to change its roof and replace the grass with zinc sheeting,  they will no longer be able to use an open fire within it without the  assistance of a smoke flue (Frescura 1981). As in the majority of cases the  flue has not found popular application in the region's architecture, it is  likely that the residents will cease to build internal fires in that dwelling  thus terminating the fumigation process. One of the probable results of this  action will be that they will need to introduce cement into the construction in  order to reduce, or eliminate, infestation. Once this switch has been made, the  family is also likely to reduce its maintenance efforts by using cement in the  floor finish. However cement floors are hard and cold to sleep on and therefore  customary mats will be replaced by European-style furniture. This implies that  a transition will also be made from a local craft-based manufacturing economy  to an externally based cash-using society. However modern furniture joinery is  normally based upon lines of 90&deg; geometry. Circular floor plans are thus  difficult to furnish and it is probable that the introduction of industrially  produced furniture will also entail a change in the floor plan from the  circular to the square, thereby also forcing changes upon the roof technology.</p>
        <p>It is obvious that few individual farmers would ever undergo such  a sequence of changes in their personal life-styles. This chain of events  therefore was built up from information obtained from a variety of unrelated  sources. Also the breakdown in rural building practices need not begin  necessarily with the termination of the fumigation process. The purchase of  furniture would often be sufficient stimulus to bring about a change in the  dwelling's floor plan, while in other recorded cases the cycle was broken when  the family, tired of the constant maintenance work required on the floor,  replaced it with cement. The re-plastering of the floor is a necessary process  for whilst the walls and roof may be successfully maintained by fumigation, the  former needs to be recoated regularly every seven to ten days or, at the most,  within a fortnight. The material used is normally a mixture of clay and cow  dung, called daka, which produces a warm, yielding and clean surface.</p>
        <p>Another important factor is the role played by the dwelling within  the larger environmental cycle of rural birth, life and death. As has been  established, rural builders draw upon the natural environment for a variety of  raw materials. These are given validity within their habitat, but once their  function ceases the dwelling is allowed to decay and, in time, its components will  return to their primary state. This means that some materials, such as soil,  are not lost to the community but are returned for reuse at a later stage.  Unfortunately this cycle could be easily interfered with by the introduction of  soil-stabilizing agents. Although their use could potentially lead to the  development of a cheap and more permanent indigenous architecture, their  indiscriminate use could also bring about the creation of large quantities of  equally permanent and unusable rubble.</p>
        <h5>THE  ECOLOGY OF RURAL SETTLEMENT</h5>
        <p>The ecological balance achieved between the settlement of rural  man and nature is a complex one, being influenced by such factors as social  custom, land ownership rights and historically-derived agrarian practices. For  the purposes of this chapter it is proposed to only give a brief resume of the  issues involved.</p>
        <p>In the past, when rural dwellers considered a site for a new  homestead, their choice was influenced by a number of factors. These had  primarily to do with an availability of resources, such as potable water and  building materials, but other elements, such as ground slope, drainage,  orientation and aspect, were also held to be important.&nbsp; In previous times elevation and defense were  also considered, but these have tended to be ignored more recently.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most critical of all these factors was an availability  of agricultural land in the immediate vicinity of the settlement. The rural  homestead is part of a self-sustaining economy which relies upon the fruits of  the soil as a major source of food. Although farmers were also pastoralists,  cattle were regarded primarily as a source of wealth to be used in the process  of obtaining brides for the family unit. The economic usufruct of cattle was  limited to the use of their milk, but even so cattle were not bred for their  milk-producing capacity and very little deliberate cattle breeding appears to  have occurred. When the slaughter of an animal did take place, it was usually  for ritual purposes, and then the whole community partook of the meat and no  attempt was made at its storage or preservation.</p>
        <p>Although this may outwardly appear to be a pragmatic course of  events based upon the inability of pre-industrial society to store its meat in  hot climes for prolonged periods of time, the cooperative nature of rural  economy makes it difficult for it to occur otherwise. The principle of sharing  resources, as well as work, is fundamental to rural philosophy. In exactly the  same manner that the fruits of the harvest are made available to the community,  so the slaughter of a beast also involves the distribution of meat according to  a pre-established code of etiquette.</p>
        <p>During  previous eras, agricultural activity was distributed across four types of  ground:</p>
        <ol type="a">
          <li>Grazing  land, which fell into two areas of seasonal activity: summer and winter  grazing. The former was usually located in close proximity to the settlement,  whilst the latter could have been at a travelling distance of several days, or  even weeks. This gave the summer grazing an opportunity to recover for the new  season.</li>
          <li>Sandy  soil planting land.</li>
          <li>Loam  soil planting land.</li>
          <li>Clay  soil planting land.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Families were usually allocated planting lands in all three soil  zones while pasturage was held in common. This made it possible to plant a  variety of crops, some vegetables being more suitable to one kind of soil than  others. It also acted as a form of insurance against the vagaries of the  weather. Generally loam soils were considered to give a good crop in an average  year; sandy soil crops prospered in wet seasons when the over-wet clay would  have allowed the seed to rot; and clay soil crops fared well in the drier years  when the clay retained moisture better than the well-drained soils.</p>
        <p>During the course of current field work, it was suggested by some  informants that three wives were considered an optimum number in the  composition of a rural family. The first or Head Wife bore the family heir and  was usually the result of an arranged marriage; the second wife might be  brought into the family at the instigation of the Head Wife, who felt she  needed assistance in fulfilling her workload; and the third wife, usually  considered to be the youngest and prettiest, was the result of a love-match  (Mfeka, pers comm). One conclusion is that the number of adults in an extended  family unit is linked to the functional aspects of its agrarian activities,  leaving the husband in charge of animal husbandry whilst each of the three  consorts had charge of one of the family's planting fields.&nbsp; It was also assumed that, in this instance,  informants were making reference to an historical ideal. Few polygamous  homesteads were recorded during the course of this study and a survey of  historical accounts during the last century reveals that even then polygamy was  limited to a wealthy elite, usually the community leaders and their advisors  (Lichtenstein 1812). This also ignores the autonomy enjoyed by women within  many rural groups, where individual wives were usually granted planting lands  in all three soil areas (Monnig 1967).</p>
        <p>A family's planting lands could be located up to 40km from each  other. Any discussion on the links between human settlement and agricultural  land should be read in a historical context, and not as a reflection of current  conditions. Since 1913, when the first Land Act was promulgated, establishing  the so-called &quot;Native Reserves&quot; the pattern of rural  agriculture has undergone radical change (Davenport and Hunt 1974). A lack of  suitable pasturage has brought about a reduction in the number of cattle, and  has therefore increased rural poverty. This has been accompanied by a rising  population within the confines of relatively small rural areas, leading to the  impoverishment of planting land and the loss of large tracts of formerly  fertile fields.</p>
        <p>Therefore a new factor has now emerged in the question of rural  settlement: that of rural overpopulation. Pictorial records of the Zululand  countryside just over a century ago show a landscape littered with small  homesteads (Illustrated London News and The Graphic 1879). Their location, far  from being haphazard, appears to have been subject to some form of distancing  determined by the amount of pasturage needed to feed the cattle of a homestead  of given size. Cattle were not a source of food, but rather acted as an indicator  of wealth and patronage. Being linked to the lobola system, cattle were  a visible sign of a clan's ability to expand and create political links with  other clans. A clan with few cattle was of little political import; one rich in  cattle was a desirable ally, to be courted and sought. Thus the powerful clans  needed more grazing land, and consequently more agricultural land, also. As a  result the size of the cattle byre in a settlement plan becomes an indicator of  its residents' level of political influence and their relative status in the  micro-economic system of their region.</p>
        <p>Aerial photographs of the Buffelshoek 471IQ area (Frescura 1981)  on the Vredefort Ring, near Parys, show that, during the mid-eighteenth  century, Sotho/Tswana groups also followed a similar, if closer, grouping of  homesteads. Both would appear to indicate the application, in human settlement,  of what Ardrey has called a &quot;territorial imperative&quot; (Ardrey  1967). The establishment of such an imperative is conditioned by the natural  resources which a settlement needs to control in order to survive as a rural  production unit. This means that the amount of land required cannot be easily  quantified and may change from region to region, from climate to climate, and  from economy to economy. It may also vary within the history of a settlement,  as its size and population numbers fluctuate.</p>
        <p>Thus, in the case of settlement in the arid regions of the  northern Cape and Botswana, a scarcity of resources has forced the inhabitants  into larger villages centering upon an availability of potable water. These are  generally large, comprising of numerous clusters of homesteads, often located  at considerable distances from each other. This differs from the coastal belt,  where an availability of water has permitted the growth of smaller and more  scattered kinship units spaced at relatively close intervals to each other.  This has given rise to a number of interesting variations in marriage customs,  kinship distributions, and hence settlement patterns, between the two groups.</p>
        <p>Similarly, the amount of land required to provide food for a group  surviving under a hunter/gatherer economy will be greater in area than that  required to feed a community of equivalent size living in a pastoral/agrarian  system. The first requires land bearing roots and berries, which are often  seasonal, and carrying game, which is usually migratory. The second makes more  intensive use of land available to it and although a migratory pattern based  upon an availability of grazing is often adopted, their farming activities are  normally of a more sedentary nature. As a result, the settlements of a  hunter/gatherer community will generally tend to be temporary, those of  agrarian pastoralists will be of a more permanent nature.</p>
        <p>A rural production unit will also generate a certain amount of  waste, partly of a natural, partly of a manufactured nature, which have to be  processed and absorbed by nature. Some, like those thrown onto a midden, are  incorporated into the rural cycle of life where farm animals contribute to the  removal of food scraps and roll in the spent ashes as a means of controlling  ticks. Others, like human wastes, are left to decompose organically and are  simply absorbed into the soil.</p>
        <p>In recent times there has been a rising incidence in southern  Africa of large scale rural, semi-urban settlements in such places as  Acornhoek, Bushbuckridge, Melelane, Thaba 'Nchu, Mabopane and Dennilton, to  name but a few. These towns are endowed with few social amenities and virtually  no supporting physical infrastructure. In such areas many historically-held  concepts of &quot;homestead&quot; have fallen by the wayside and the  control of land for agricultural purposes has been overtaken by a need for  residential space. The competition for building resources has also forced rural  builders into modifying rural technologies in order to provide themselves with  housing of an acceptable standard. Despite a lack of fresh water and waste  removal facilities, many communities have generally met with a remarkably high  degree of success. However, in other areas, population densities have reached  such concentrations that natural processes have not been able to keep up with  the inflow of waste materials, resulting in the pollution of their water  resources. The outbreaks of cholera experienced in the central and western  Transvaal during the summer of 1981-1982 must be attributed directly to an  overburdening of rural land by human settlements having near-urban densities,  but little infrastructure (Frescura 1983).</p>
        <h5>A  COMMUNITY OF BUILDERS</h5>
        <p>The concept of a vernacular architecture is also closely linked to  the social processes of rural society. The construction of a dwelling is  considered to be more than the mere provision of shelter; in many ways it acts  as an opportunity for the community to collaborate together on a project,  turning what is an outwardly social occasion into a display of solidarity  between the larger group as a whole and the individual family. This not only  tends to reinforce the rural sense of identity but, in architectural terms, it  brings the individual family's dwelling in line with the community's norms,  both in its construction and its aesthetics.</p>
        <p>The symbolism of this act is important.&nbsp; Historically, rural society has always placed  a strong emphasis upon role playing and task fulfillment. This creates a strong  awareness in individuals of their role in society and their personal  contributions to its survival as a production unit. Anti-social behaviour is  quickly identified and corrected and peer group pressure plays an important  role in suppressing deviancy from the group's norms. This contrasts sharply  with modern western urban society where a sense of identity is often associated  with deviancy from its norms and, in some instances, is actually promoted and  even applauded. In a sense therefore southern African rural society may be  perceived to encourage self-identity through participation in group activities  and, unlike western society where originality of style in domestic architecture  is seen as a desirable statement of self, the former uses group participation  as a means of ensuring norm conformance by its individual members.</p>
        <p>The differences between urban and rural residents, therefore, may  be seen to center upon their individual perceptions of their own basic economic  and social units. In western urban society the lowest common social denominator  is the nuclear monogamous family, whose members may participate in the economic  activities of the larger community, but generally need not exercise a direct  control upon resources, or the processes of production, in order to ensure  their economic survival. The southern African rural social unit, on the other  hand, is the extended and potentially polygamous family which historically has  depended upon a continued control of both natural resources and independent  means of production in order to secure its economic well-being. The first has  developed a concept of &quot;home&quot; which currently emphasizes the  residence of the individual family, and commonly expects that its progeny will  move off, often before marriage takes place, to establish core groups of their  own. This process of fission therefore lays stress upon the individual as a  potentially independent economic unit able to exist apart from the larger  family group.</p>
        <p>In contrast, the southern African rural community views the  habitat as the abode of the larger group, within which individual members are  given residence in commensuration with their age, gender and status. Fission  within the group can, and often does, take place for social and economic  reasons, but the individual is not expected to leave before marriage and, in  many cases, is encouraged to take up residence within the parent settlement  after it has taken place. Where schisms do occur within the larger community, the  split is usually physical, and symbolic and social links are often retained  between the parts. The retention of such connections is part of a mechanism for  reinforcing the status of the individual family within the larger community  which emphasizes the place of the individual within the group, as well as the  roles of economic collaboration and interdependence existing between the two.</p>
        <p>The participation of the group in the provision of shelter for the  individual family also provides a valuable insight into the attitudes and  values of the rural community. By elevating building to the level of a group  activity, it has been placed alongside other communal functions such as  harvesting and defense, thus, in a sense, recognizing its importance as an  element of rural survival.</p>
        <p>Rural construction must also be seen in the context of the  processes of interaction existing between gender and age groups in agrarian  society. All members of the community are considered to have a role to play in  the building of a dwelling. In some groups the young may weave grass ropes in  the evenings under the guidance of their elders whilst listening to folk tales  and singing memory-training songs; women will be out collecting thatching grass  and, later, will build and plaster the clay walls; the men will seek out the  best building timbers, make the structure and thatch the roof. Although the  division of labour between genders must, at one time, have been strongly  defined, this separation has tended to disappear in more recent times, due  largely to the prolonged absence of men, absent in the urban areas as migrant  workers. In many cases this has forced women into fulfilling some of the tasks  previously allocated to men in the provision of shelter. Moreover, the  traditional division of building tasks between genders is not always constant  from region to region. For example one group may assign the task of thatching  to women while another may reserve the construction of the entire roof for the  men.</p>
        <p>The impact that the absence of any one particular member of the  family unit may have upon the final built product is difficult to assess.  Certainly, among some groups, an absence of courtyard walls may denote the home  of a newly married couple, of a childless wife, or of a single male. Among the  Pedi of Sekhukhuneland, failure to marry is considered to be an antisocial act  and although not directly punishable, it may be subject to a measure of social  sanction.</p>
        <p>A bachelor would be treated as a &quot;young boy&quot; for  as long as that condition was maintained, and would be prevented from taking  his place at gatherings of the men, thus effectively depriving him of full  political rights (Monnig 1967). He would also not be accorded the courtesy of  the community's assistance in the construction of his dwelling.</p>
        <h5>PRODUCER  vs CONSUMER</h5>
        <p>Perhaps one of the more relevant lessons provided by rural  architecture lies in the economics of its production. At a time when many  countries in the developing world are beginning to look to self-help methods as  a means of resolving their local housing problems, the rural built environment  offers the dynamics which may make such programs viable. Among the first to  point this out was Amos Rapoport who, writing in a different context in 1969,  saw the vernacular as the link existing between what he termed &quot;primitive&quot;  and &quot;high style&quot; architectures. Rapoport's model uses  socio-economic terms of reference to describe the processes of architecture at  three levels of society: agrarian, pre-industrial and modern. Although the  distinctions he makes are somewhat too general to be entirely applicable in the  southern African context, the relationships which he described are nonetheless  still valid. By extending his model it becomes possible to divide the  vernacular architecture of the region into a number of interlinked stages.</p>
        <p>Because of the difficulties involved in creating hierarchies and  stereotypes based upon housing technology, these phases have been based upon a  range of economic activities and the kind of architectures that each gives rise  to. This does not mean to say that any one community can only be described in  terms of one specific mode of production. A farming pastoralist group, for  example, may have hunter-gatherer, migrant pastoralist, craft and trading  functions in its economic make-up. Each one of these activities however will be  typified by particular attitudes and sets of values towards the structures  needed to house them, giving rise in each case to dwelling types which will  become identifiable as belonging to a particular aspect of economic life.</p>
        <ol type="a">
          <li>Hunting  and gathering are  staple economic activities generally associated with regions of impoverished  land resources or with societies lacking in basic agrarian skills. In spite of  the fact that hunter-gatherers generally built shelters which were impermanent,  often roughly constructed and easily discarded, they are also known to have had  a large number of dwelling forms in their architectural vocabulary.  Hunter-gatherer societies in the southern African region were not static but had  a dynamic interrelationship with the migrant pastoralist economy (Elphick  1977). For any number of reasons a group could evolve into the next economic  system and could, just as easily, devolve back again. For this reason  travellers to the region during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth  centuries unable in many cases to distinguish between the dwellings of  hunter-gathering San and those of migrant pastoralist Khoikhoi (Burchell 1953,  and others). It is also recorded that over a century ago the Masarwa, a San  group, were building their dwellings, albeit imperfectly, in the style of their  Tswana neighbours (Campbell 1815). This, however, may have been the result of  their society moving into a sedentary farming pastoralist mode of production.</li>
          <li>Migrant  pastoralist activities  are generally associated with regions of impoverished land resources and low  rainfalls where pasturage is sparse and must be conserved to prevent  encroaching desertification. This will necessitate a cattle-based economy where  farming groups are forced to make frequent moves from one grazing place to the  next. As a result residents of such areas developed a sophisticated form of  portable dwellings which could be rapidly deployed according to the nomadic  needs of their inhabitants (Burchell 1953). Although it is true that their  range of forms was somewhat limited, this must be attributed to the limitations  of the technology available.</li>
          <li>The  evolution of a migrant pastoralist economy into one based upon more sedentary  agricultural pastoralist activities is normally conditioned by increased  competition for pastorage together with an availability of lands suitable for  planting. This is generally accompanied by the development of concepts relating  to land tenure, as well as value systems identifying the dwelling as being a  more or less permanent fixture in the rural landscape. This means that  architecture becomes, among other things, a statement of land holding, with  implications of roots, of heritage, and of continuity. Although agrarian pastoralist  activities are often housed in a variety of structures, these are marked by  their nature and materials of construction, both of which have an implied  element of permanence. It is probable that early agricultural pastoralists  relied upon grazing activities to a great degree and therefore these farmers  erected lightly-built dwellings based upon a timber and grass technology which,  although difficult to move, retained a measure of mobility. In time increased  population densities reduced such options, making the movement of settlement  impractical and wasteful of resources. Late agricultural pastoralist  communities are therefore marked by an increasing reliance upon planting  activities, producing an architecture which made increasing use of materials  such as stone and clay. Their settlements were also strongly structured along  formal lines of social, family, gender and age hierarchies. During this, as  well as other preceding stages, the roles of consumer, or client, as well as  that of producer, or builder, was filled by the same person or within one  family. Although the technical expertise of the &quot;better&quot;  thatcher, or more &quot;proficient&quot; builder are often recognised  and publicly lauded, such skills are seldom the subject of specialization or  given to specific economic reward. Every person in the community is  knowledgeable of the tasks involved in the building process and, given the  limits of gender and age specialization, is able to perform them in the  construction of their dwellings.</li>
          <li>Craft  manufacturing economies  have their roots in the production of functional artifacts for the internal  consumption of the agricultural pastoralist community. In time a combination of  exclusive access to materials as well as increasing skill of production has  induced farmer-manufacturers to barter their surpluses with groups holding  similar monopolies. The changeover from an agrarian economic system to one of  manufacture is gradual and only takes place when a hierarchy of values had been  established in the bartering process, usually through the introduction of a  formal monetary system. Manufacture has also encouraged settlement based upon  an availability of resources which, when combined with an availability of  markets, generated small urban growth. In most cases however, craft production  has remained centred upon the rural homestead.<br />
            The creation of small agrarian-based  communities of crafters brought about specific changes in their architecture.  Initially crafts remained within the home, but as their scope of production  grew, so then manufacturing activities spread into specialist buildings.  Because of their nature, these often posed a threat to the village, both  through pollution and fire. This induced some people to introduce more  permanent, and less flammable, materials in their construction, moving away  from timber and thatch to stone, clay and slate.<br />
            The social values, based upon family and  gender hierarchies, which formerly structured settlement were replaced by ones  focusing upon the social, religious and economic life of the community. In this  way the common, the church and the market place gained architectural  recognition.<br />
            For the purposes of this analysis, the  architecture of this era can be regarded in two distinct phases. During the  first it is probable that, in most cases, the roles of producer and consumer in  the building process remained essentially unaltered from that of previous eras.  It is true that this period sees the rise of specialized builders-craftsmen,  specifically thatching experts, but both builder and client share in the same  building language and traditions and, if necessary, the owner could conduct the  work without assistance. This condition is carried through to the second phase,  although an increasing separation between agrarian and manufacturing activities  encourages the specialization of building functions.</li>
          <li>The  development from a craft-based to a trade-based community signals the  end of reliance upon agrarian methods of production and the switch-over to  full-time manufacturing activities. The centre of social and economic activity  becomes the town which serves not only the needs of its residents but also  those of the surrounding region. The centralization of facilities also creates  a focus of administration as well as resources, requiring protection and hence  fortification. This leads to higher population densities within the walls  necessitating the replacement of inflammable building materials, as well as the  invention of new technologies to facilitate the vertical spread of residences  to two or more storeys. In spite of this building methods and materials remain  linked with those used in the immediate countryside. Increased densities also  required the introduction of specialist infrastructures for the supply of  potable water and the removal of wastes. During this time, the market, the  square and the church or temple are confirmed as primary foci of social  activity. Two new specialist social classes also arise during this time, the  bureaucrat and the career soldier, while craft manufacture becomes entrenched  in a system of guilds.<br />
            Not unnaturally an increased  specialization in the manufacturing sector also brings about the separation of  building functions into a number of distinct trades. This is encouraged by the  rise of guilds in other areas of production, as well as the introduction of new  building methods to facilitate multi-storey construction. During this time the  roles of client and builder are therefore irrevocably separated. Although  during the early stages of this era both parties share in a common knowledge of  the local architectural language and its building tradition, by its end the gap  between consumer and producer has widened to the point where the client ceases  to be an active participant in the building process. The division between consumer  and producer is bridged by the rise of a new profession, the specialist  designer, although during this time this role is fulfilled by the master  crafter, usually the project mason or carpenter.</li>
          <li>During  the early industrial economic system the focus of the community's  primary economic activities begin to shift at an increasing pace from the  countryside to the town. Not only do the urban areas act as major generators of  employment and wealth but, as happened in many historical instances, they also  become havens for peasants and rural crafters fleeing land dispossession, rural  poverty, increasing capitalization of farming activities, unequal distributions  of the tax burden and oppressive feudal socio-political systems. Although the  urban guild system is relatively difficult for outsiders to enter, the  opportunities for economic development in the town are infinitely preferable to  conditions prevailing in the countryside.<br />
            The architecture of this period largely  continues the building traditions of the previous era. However it also marks a  breakpoint with its rural roots, both technological and aesthetic. Much of the  domestic and infrastructural work is still being conducted under the guidance  of master builders, but the new profession of the architect begins to gain  ground as part of a newly-established beau art tradition separate from the  guild system. However the scope of the architect-artist remains limited to the  design of larger public works and the homes of the rich, the powerful and the  ostentatious.</li>
          <li>Industrial  society heralds  the virtual end of land-based craft manufacture, and the centralization of all  such activities in urban areas. The concept of &quot;craft&quot; also  begins to disappear as, in most cases, machinery takes over the production of  artifacts on a mass basis. This breakdown is promoted on the rural side by the  introduction of mechanized capital-intensive modes of agricultural production,  which make many small-scale marginal farmers and crafters uneconomical and  force them to migrate off their lands and into the cities. Faced with the loss  of agricultural activities as a supplement to their income from small-scale  manufacture, many crafters are left with little choice but to enter employment  in urban areas where urban-based industries are supported by a growing railway  infrastructure and the availability as a power source.<br />
            During this period architecture abandons  all links with its historical rural roots. Faced with the needs of meeting the  housing and infrastructural requirements of a growing urban population, the  processes of building become increasingly industrialized. However the  incorporation of industrial material in domestic architecture gives rise to an  aesthetic which is now sometimes referred to as an &quot;industrial  vernacular&quot;. The consumer loses all control of the production process,  becoming part of an amorphous industrial proletariat to be dealt with on a mass  basis. The disciplines of engineering and town planning emerge as professions  in their own right, competing with architecture in areas of structural and  social design. Faced with this challenge architects emphasize their specialist  design and management skills, shed many of their beau arts links and, to a  small degree, return to the medieval ideal of placing a master crafter in  charge of the project. Architecture ceases to be concerned predominantly with  domestic structures and begins to include an increasing range of forms to  accommodate a wide range of human activities.</li>
          <li>During  this final stage of post-industrial economic activity, building is  dominated by industrial processes which emphasize technology and cash-intensive  modes of production. These are supported by a wide range of newly-evolved  specialist skills and although architects retain a pivotal coordinating role in  the design process, many of the guiding decisions are made by technologists and  town planners. The architect however, becomes a mediator between the client and  the team of specialist builders and as such retains control on behalf of the  client, over the project. Unfortunately this mediation is only possible where  the consumer can afford the luxury of such specialist services, making the  profession relevant only in those countries with well-developed economies. In  other areas, where economic systems are either developing or under- developed,  the services of architects are limited to a small number of elite or  large-scale projects.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>In a larger sense this analysis is concerned with the relationship  existing, in the building process, between producer and consumer. In a rural  economy the two roles are generally incorporated in the same person. The  client, who more often than not is also the builder, has an intimate knowledge  of the building process and is aware of the type, style and form of the  structure which is being erected. By way of contrast, virtually all building  activity in urban areas is in the hands of specialist craftsmen. In some cases  this is also enforced by legislation. Clients have no hand in and usually even  no knowledge of the building process; and unless wealthy enough to be able to  employ the services of a specialist designer, they will have only the most  superficial of choices in the aesthetics of their dwellings. Often the  structure will be purchased already completed much like an appliance at a  retail store.</p>
        <p>Rural architecture short-cuts the relationship established in  modern urban society between consumer and producer. Because it uses locally  available materials, incorporating them into a highly functional structure and  employing the cheapest labour possible, that of the client, it is both a  functional and an economic way of building. It therefore offers a solution to  at least some of the problems which beset the current provision of housing in  the developing world, where the choice most often is not between a pretty house  and an ugly house, but between having a house and no house at all.</p>
