	    CULTURE IN TRANSITION IN SOUTH AFRICA 
	    LECTURE 2: TRADITIONAL SETTLEMENT IN SOUTH AFRICA</h5>
	  <h5>INTODUCTION</h5>
	  <p>Any discussion about the nature of indigenous settlement in Africa  should also take into consideration polygamy, a practice which western,  Christian tradition holds to be a state oppressive of women for the benefit of  men. The concept of &quot;male sexual domination&quot; in a society  where both men and women collaborate freely in economic activities, and where  the control of resources and their means of production is protected by a system  of checks and cross-checks, enshrined in custom and tradition, is a  contradiction which has never been fully challenged.</p>
	  <h5>BRIEF HISTORY  OF POLYGAMY IN SOUTHERN AFRICA</h5>
	  <p>One of the preconceptions more popularly held by both academics  and lay public alike in regard to southern African rural society is that the  indigenous family unit is polygamous in nature. This is only partly true. A broad  survey of homestead patterns in the region reveals that whilst a number of  polygamous settlements were documented during the course of current research,  these were in a distinct minority and that monogamous marriages appeared to be  the more general norm. It could of course be argued that this is a recent  development brought about by the work of Christian missionaries, but the  validity of such a statement should not be left to go unquestioned. For one  thing the Christian churches which enjoy the largest following in southern  Africa, the so-called Independent Churches, permit their followers to practice  polygamy. For another, it was found that although this practice indeed appears  to have been more prevalent during the last century than it is today, its presence  was not as widespread as various missionaries way have wished us to believe.  Lichtenstein wrote of the Xhosa in 1812 that &quot;Most of the Koossas have  but one wife; the kings and chiefs of the kraals only have four or five.&quot;</p>
	  <p>This was reinforced by Alberti who stated, also of the Xhosa, that  &ldquo;<em>Those with least resources, must be satisfied with one woman, others have  two, and rarely more.</em>&rdquo;</p>
	  <p>Contemporary visitors to other parts of the country came to  similar conclusions. Livingstone went one step further and in 1857 estimated  that approximately 43% of Tswana men practiced polygamy and then only a very  small minority of these had more than three wives. By 1946 an official census  revealed that this figure had dropped to 11% with only 1.3% having three wives  or more.</p>
	  <p>The practice of polygamy may, in most cases, be explained in terms  of a levirate, a social practice, used to ensure the continued status and  survival of widows and orphans within an established family structure. While it  is true, therefore, that every rural family is potentially polygamous in  nature, we need to question whether such polygamy was the result of &quot;male  sexuality and lust&quot; or merely the enforcement of social obligations  intended to reinforce ties between family or clan groupings. Recently obtained  data would seem to show that, currently, 27% of rural households are headed by  widowed or single women. If we were to assume that in the 1850s an equivalent  number of women could have become widows and were thus absorbed into the  monogamous households of family members, thus making them polygamous, then it  will be seen that this form of union could have accounted for most of the  polygamous marriages recorded by Livingstone among the Tswana. The remaining  group, those with three wives or more, were a distinct minority and their  polygamy may be explained in terms of group leaders creating political  alliances and gaining control of resources for their own communities.</p>
	  <p>The general trend away from polygamous unions evidenced since 1920  could therefore be explained in two ways. The growth of urbanisation and the  establishment of urban-based political structures has brought about a decreased  emphasis upon both regional group identity and the power of the traditional and  inherited rural leadership. The need for making unions based upon political  expediency has thus lessened considerably. The economics of obtaining a bride  in the rural areas has also changed substantially over the past five  generations, as women, after the 1930s, also began to enter in increasing  numbers the ranks of an industrialised and urban proletariat.</p>
	  <p>Despite such developments, however, when considering the nature of  indigenous settlement, the principles of polygamy remain predominant, and  although polygamous households today are few and far between, every rural  homestead and village is still being planned out as if it could, at some stage,  become polygamous.</p>
	  <h5>SOME  GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF RURAL SETTLEMENT</h5>
	  <p>The idea of &quot;<em>rural settlement</em>&quot; as a series of  huts placed haphazardly over the southern African countryside is plainly  mistaken. Not only is the indigenous homestead subject to a number of  principles which govern the distribution of its constituent parts but such  principles may be interpreted to represent a cognitive and unspoken language  which involves not only the social, political, economic, sexual, inheritance  and religious values of the people concerned but, in many ways also acts as a  mirror to their cosmological beliefs as a whole. As such therefore, it may be  concluded that the usage of space within the domestic settlement represents a  more reliable guideline to cultural pattern and group identity than other  elements, such as dwelling form and decorative motif, which historical research  has proved to be open to pragmatic manipulation.</p>
	  <p>Conceive, if you will, of a society which places, at the core of  its settlement, its ancestral spirits or &ldquo;<em>shades</em>&rdquo;, whose guidance and  wisdom is sought daily in the resolution of family affairs and petty squabbles.  They are key to the maintenance of &ldquo;<em>order</em>&rdquo;, while on the outer perimeter  of the settlement lurk strangers, wild nature, dangerous animals, famine and  war; in other words &ldquo;<em>chaos</em>&rdquo;. The maintenance of inner order against  outer chaos is given over to the men, who are able to communicate with the  ancestors, and through them, administer, rule and pass regulations. As a result  the inner space of a rural homestead, variously known as an &ldquo;isibaya&rdquo; or  a &ldquo;<em>kgoro</em>&rdquo;, becomes the place of the men where they discuss group  affairs, hold beer drinks, administer laws, resolve disputes, and commune with  the ancestors. The central area is also associated with burial, the keeping of  cattle, the group&rsquo;s wealth, and the storage of emergency grain rations. Women  still at the age of menstruation are generally not admitted to this area, as  they are considered to be susceptible to the forces of chaos, especially during  their monthly periods.</p>
	  <p>Nonetheless the task of mediating between inner order and outer  chaos falls upon the women, who control the residential space located about the  central core. They also see to its maintenance, keep the area immediately  beyond clear of surface vegetation, and conduct all farming activity. Thus the  real control of the homestead and its daily life lies in the hands of women,  although its ownership, symbolically at least, lies with the men. In the  constant daily struggle to retain the fine balance between &ldquo;order&rdquo; and &ldquo;chaos&rdquo;,  the two genders are perceived to be equal partners.</p>
	  <p>The principles or, if we wish, the vocabulary of such a language  of settlement are based upon the following factors:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>General  architectural form and governing axes.</li>
	    <li>Aspect  and direction of approach and orientation.</li>
	    <li>Hierarchical  determination and the relationships existing between husband and wife (or  wives), parents and children, family and visitors, domestic unit and community.</li>
	    <li>Inheritance  patterns.</li>
	    <li>The  architectural expression of territorial statements, common spaces, work areas  and privacy.</li>
	    <li>Areas  of interaction between the individual family unit and the community as a whole.</li>
	    <li>Position  of byre and other animal enclosures.</li>
	    <li>Position  of cooking facilities and attendant work functions.</li>
	    <li>Location  of burial areas and places of religious significance.</li>
	    <li>Other  considerations such as seating hierarchies, spatial divisions determined by sex  and age etc.</li>
	    </ul>
	  <p>When these values were applied to a wide range of examples, it  became evident that the southern African region is currently the home to two  major architectural groupings: the Venda, a small minority inhabiting the  northern reaches of the Transvaal, and the larger Nguni/Sotho/Tswana family, or  virtually the remaining indigenous population of southern Africa.</p>
	  <h5>THE  CONCEPTS OF &quot;LEFT&rdquo; AND &ldquo;RIGHT&quot;</h5>
	  <p>This is based upon the hierarchical relationship perceived to  exist between the &quot;Head&quot; and subsequent wives of a polygamous  marriage. The interpretation of which hand is assumed to be ascendant varies  from group to group and is the subject of numerous historical anecdotes or  myths. Generally speaking it may be said that those groups who hold &quot;right&quot;  to be superior to &quot;left&quot; explain this by means of a metaphor  which reflects an old rural belief that a warrior wields his spear with his  right hand and his shield with his left. The right is therefore assumed to have  an ascendance over the left being &quot;active&quot; and &quot;aggressive&quot;  whilst the left is &quot;passive&quot; and &quot;defensive&quot;.</p>
	  <h5>THE  CONCEPTS OF &ldquo;FRONT&rdquo; AND &ldquo;BACK&rdquo;</h5>
	  <p>A second hierarchical differentiation which may be said to exist  in indigenous settlement arises between those domestic units and homesteads closest  to the central common, the parental space, and those located on the external  perimeter, the residences of married children. Although strictly speaking such  a differentiation can best be described as one existing between &quot;centre&quot;  and &quot;perimeter&quot;, this is only valid for as long as the  settlement form remains circular. Once the built environment breaks up into  individual homesteads which tend to follow a linear pattern along contour  lines, then it will be seen that the traditional centre-perimeter apposition  will become translated into one based upon the concept of front and back.</p>
	  <h5>THE ZULU</h5>
	  <p>Traditional Nguni domestic settlement  has followed a circular pattern enclosing a central cattle byre surrounded by  individual dwelling units. The cattle byre and, in some instances the outside  perimeter, were demarcated by a palisade of timber logs. Ideally the homestead  was located on a gentle, east-facing slope with the main entrance located at  its lowest point. The Great Hut, which was the residence of the family head and  his First Wife, was sited on axis with the entrance, at the opposite, or upper,  end of the circle. The dwellings of second and subsequent wives were then  placed alternatively on either side of the Great Hut, in descending order of  importance. The imaginary axis thus created served to divide the extended  family unit into Left-Hand and Right-Hand Houses, thus  establishing a hierarchy between the House of the First or Great Wife,  who bears the future family head, and the Second House, which acts as  its support group. The interpretation of which Hand was dominant, the Left or  the Right, has tended to vary from group to group. Each wife had her own  cooking hut, located to the rear of her residence, but she was also expected to  participate in the preparation of her husband&rsquo;s meal, in the Great wife&rsquo;s own  kitchen. Understandably, this was the area where most family quarrels tended to  originate.</p>
	  <p>The dwellings of the children and of  visitors were located in the lower sector of the circle, closest to the entrance.  Although the homestead as a whole came under the titular leadership of the  patriarchal family head, the various dwelling units fell under the control of  individual wives, who also had access to their own granaries and food stores.  Supplementary granaries were buried in pits inside in the cattle byre, where  they came under the control of the family&rsquo;s men but, in an emergency, were made  available to the group as a whole. The byre was generally acknowledged to be  the preserve of adult male activity, but was also associated with religious  ritual and burial. Older women were allowed to enter the byre, but only after  they had reached a post-menstrual age. Entrance to the byre was gained at its  upper end, closest to the Great Hut, and on the same axis as the main entrance  to the homestead.</p>
	  <p>Traditionally Zulu settlement has  tended to follow the Nguni model, and although a general decline in the  practice of polygamy has made such orderings largely irrelevant, the broad  symbolism attached to the main elements of the homestead are still being  followed today. Thus the homestead will always face downhill, preferably to the  east, the cattle byre will be located before the parent&rsquo;s dwelling, the cooking  area will be found to the rear, the children&rsquo;s residences will be located  closest to the point of entry, and the divisions of gender control in homestead  spaces are still being applied. Burial may no longer take place in the byre,  but its space remains associated with the men, sacred rites, and communion with  the ancestors.</p>
	  <p>Before 1822 cattle returning to their  byre in the late afternoon, would follow a circuitous route and make their  entrance into the central space through a gate located at the head of the  circle, at a point opposite the Great Hut. However after 1822, and the  establishment of the Zulu Kingdom under Shaka, this gate was relocated to the  lower end of the circle, away from the Great Hut and closest to the main  entrance to the settlement. This created a direct axial approach into the inner  cattle area and reinforced the position and status of the Great Hut at the head  of the circle. Initially this was a feature of Zulu Royal settlements and  regional administrative capitals, but within a generation it appears to have  become the standard pattern followed by all domestic homesteads in this region. </p>
	  <p>Like their smaller domestic  counterparts, Zulu Royal towns were circular in form, faced east down a gentle  slope, and had a central space given over to cattle and the activities of men.  The quarters of the King and his wives were located at the upper end of the  circle, while entry was gained at the lower and opposite end. However, this is  where all similarity with its domestic counterpart ceased. Apart from the royal  family, only some of who resided there on a permanent basis, a Royal capital  was a regional administrative center as well as a military barracks, populated  entirely by unmarried warriors belonging to one or more of the King&rsquo;s  regiments. Consequently all ordering along the lines of Left Hand and Right  Hand became redundant and, except for the Royal enclosure, all gender-based  divisions of space fell away. The central space was used by the King as his  Court, often involving military parades, national celebrations, legal  proceedings, the hearing of petitions, and the reception of foreign  dignitaries, and only a small portion, at the upper end, was given over for a  small select herd of the King&rsquo;s cattle. Royal capitals were extensive in size,  measuring between 800m and 1600m in diameter, and capable of housing up to 6000  persons.</p>
	  <h5>THE NDEBELE</h5>
	  <p>Historically  the larger Ndebele settlement was built in the shape of an open fan, with a  large circular space containing the cattle byre and the gathering place for the  men being located at its center. The dwelling of the first wife of the senior  man was located at the head of the settlement, on axis with the main entry to  the central space. Other wives of the senior man were then allocated homes on  either side of the first wife, on a left-and-right basis in descending order of  status. The homes of his brothers, or other members of his retinue, were  located alternatively to the left and right of his abode. Where such men also  had polygamous families, their own homes were also structured according to an  internal left-and-right arrangement. Married male children were usually  allocated dwelling space behind the homestead of their mother, and they too  followed a left-and-right ordering. However, by the third generation the demand  for space rendered all such pretense for hierarchy nonsensical, and the  settlement was either reformed, or it divided into two separate homesteads.</p>
	  <p>By the  1940s most Ndebele settlements had changed to a linear pattern. The homes of  individual family members were still laid out according to their status in a  left-and-right hierarchy, but the homestead now followed the land&rsquo;s lines of  contour, an arrangement which made better use of their farming resources. The  cattle byre, although still central, was now in a square, and was located  opposite the home of the senior member of the family.</p>
	  <p>A metaphor used by some Ndebele to describe their built habitat  likens the spaces of the homestead to the body of a woman. In their terms the  front courtyard, generally an area of &quot;clean&quot; activities, is  likened to the mapoto or beaded apron worn by married women as part of  their wedding finery; the parents' dwelling is the womb for it is here the  mother resides and hence it is the origin of the family's fertility, its  children and hence its wealth, originate. The rear quarters which house the  cooking areas as well as the children are the breasts whence all nourishment  originates. This symbolism is reinforced during the wedding celebrations when  the men dance through the front courtyard of the bride's family homestead,  thereby ritually defiling it to the accompaniment of ribald jokes from their  womenfolk.</p>
	  <h5>THE TSWANA</h5>
	  <p>The Tswana were probably the first  indigenous group in southern Africa to achieve settlements of such size that,  in modern terms, could be described as being &ldquo;urban&rdquo;. Arriving at a time  when the average colonial town in the Cape was little larger than 300 to 600  persons, early nineteenth century travelers to the region were astounded to  discover the presence of indigenous towns ranging in size from five to sixteen  thousand people. Despite their large populations, Tswana towns were by no means  permanent, and Dithakong, the Tlhaping capital, is known to have moved three  times between 1802 and 1814.</p>
	  <p>The Tswana  town was constituted of a number of extended family clusters, often containing  the dwellings of the senior male, his wife or wives, and those of his brothers,  together with their children. Unlike the Nguni, whose sons married out of the  family, the preferred wife of a Tswana male was his first cousin on the father&rsquo;s  side, and the only time that the family unit was physically divided was when it  either became too large and unwieldy to administer, or when competing interests  within the family made it desirable. The homesteads of individual families were  grouped fan-like about a central space containing the cattle byre and a  gathering place for the males. The family cluster was structured according to a  hierarchy based upon the relationship perceived to exist between the Left Hand  and the Right Hand, where the senior brother in a family was accorded  precedence over his siblings, and the senior wife in a polygamous marriage was  accorded precedence over subsequent wives. </p>
	  <p>Each wife was accorded her own  dwelling unit, which was surrounded by a system of inter-leading walled courtyards,  sometimes referred to by archaeologists as &ldquo;bilobial&rdquo;. The front  courtyard or &ldquo;lobe&rdquo; acted as a space for social interaction for the  women of the household, whereas the rear lobe was used as a work space.  Additional structures, such as the kitchen, granaries and sleeping facilities  for the children also gave off this rear space. During the course of current  research a number of cases were recorded where the rear courtyard was  subdivided into a complex series of service spaces, such as one might expect in  any rural household. Also, in a number of cases, the rear verandah was used for  the storage of grain and water, often in large pots buried in the floor.</p>
	  <h5>THE VENDA</h5>
	  <p>The homestead  architecture of the Venda can be said to be unique in the context of southern  Africa, for while all other groups use a system of hierarchical differentiation  based upon the concept of &ldquo;left and right&rdquo;, in their case all  distinction is made in terms of &ldquo;front and back&rdquo;. Often also, the concept of &ldquo;front&rdquo;  is synonymous with &ldquo;downhill&rdquo;, while &ldquo;back&rdquo; is used to mean &ldquo;uphill&rdquo;.  Historical evidence appears to indicate that, originally, Venda settlement  followed the circular pattern of their Nguni/Sotho/Tswana neighbours further  south, but archaeologists have not yet established when this separation took  place.</p>
	  <p>Such a differentiation becomes evident at the level of the  domestic unit, where the dwellings and activity centers of the wife, (or wives  in a polygamous union), will be located before and preferably downhill from  those of the father and family head. Similarly the homesteads of a man's sons  will be placed in front of and downhill from that of the parent. The settlement  of a Venda chief or headman will tend to follow the same basic pattern as that  applicable to his people, except that the process of ascent to his quarters  will be complicated by the introduction of defensive ramparts and narrow access  passages, all designed to protect his person in the case of attack. An old  Venda proverb states that &quot;to climb  a mountain you must follow a zig-zag path&quot;, an obvious metaphor for  their chiefs and the structure of their society.</p>
	  <p>Venda settlement is also differentiated from that of their  neighbours in southern Africa by the fact that, in a polygamous marriage, the  Venda father has a separate dwelling in his own right, with its own courtyards  and, in some cases, its own granary. This contrasts sharply with the practice  of most other southern African groups where, under similar circumstances, the  dwelling of the first wife is recognised to be that of the father. This also  means that, with the exception of the Head Wife, no hierarchy of settlement is  followed in determining the position of second and subsequent wives, the  location of their dwellings being a matter of personal preference and group  negotiation.</p>
	  <h5>CONCLUSION</h5>
	  <p>Developments in indigenous architectural culture over the past  century need to be read in the wider context of socio-economic and political  patterns of the southern African region. They took place at a time when its  people saw the loss of their military and political power; the dispossession  and occupation of their lands; the placing of whole families into indentured  employment on white-owned farms; and the channeling of their men-folk in to a  migrant labour system which separated them from their families for years at a  time. This began to establish some of the preconditions for the undermining of  traditional patrifocal patterns and their replacement with elements of  matrifocality. As a result many elements of settlement which we today regard as  &ldquo;traditional&rdquo;, have been reduced to vestigial traces, barely  recognizable from their historical roots.</p>
	  <h5>POSTSCRIPT</h5>
	  <p>This was the second  of four lectures on the subject of Culture in Transition in South Africa,  delivered to the Faculty of Architecture and Society, Campus Leonardo, at the Politecnico of  Milano, Italy, on 16 May 2007, and was entitled Il Sistema Urbanistico dei  Popoli Indigeni Sudafricani. It has been reproduced here in both Italian  and English for the benefit of Italian-speaking students who attended the  course. I am grateful to Prof Santa Nipoti, of Bologna who, not only did the  bulk of this translation, but also put forward a number of positive suggestions  aimed at making these ideas more comprehensible to an Italian audience.</p>
