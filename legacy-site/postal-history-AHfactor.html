	  	    <h5>THE AH! FACTOR - A New Way of  Exhibiting a Very Old Way  of Collecting
	  	      </h5>
	                    </h5>
	  	    <p>Franco Frescura	    </p>
	  <p>Now  that the &ldquo;Open&rdquo; class of exhibiting has become an established fixture of  national philately, the time may be ripe for us to start re-examining some of  the other long-cherished values and principles of stamp collecting. Philately,  we are constantly warned, is &ldquo;in dire straits&rdquo;, and by all accounts has  been there for some time. The rising use of faxes and e-mails for our  correspondence, and the increasing popularity of video games amongst the youth  are the two most frequently quoted excuses as to why so few new people are  joining our fraternity. </p>
	  <p>However most people are forgetting  that the SA Post Office still handles some 9 million letters per day, 27% of  which still use stamps, that the vast majority of our population have no access  to the electronic media, and that most philatelists only enter the hobby after  the age of 35, well after computer games have ceased to be a factor in their  lives. The truth is that &ldquo;snail-mail&rdquo; is likely to remain a fixture in  our society for at least the next generation or two, and that people only turn  to a serious hobby once they have married, settled down to a job and a family,  and begin to have a small disposable income which won&rsquo;t be missed from the  family budget.</p>
	  <p>Please  also note how I deliberately use the word &ldquo;fraternity&rdquo;, meaning a  fellowship of men, to describe philately. The female equivalent is &ldquo;sorority&rdquo;,  and is seldom, if indeed ever, applied to describe gatherings of stamp collectors.  So, if the average gathering of philatelists is normally a gathering of men,  then we can assume that the rules and values that govern philately as a hobby  are those of men.</p>
	  <p>The  reality therefore is that if our hobby is failing, it is for different reasons  than the inevitable march of technological progress. As always, we are in  competition with other hobbies, which offer more or less the same advantages as  philately, and the same opportunities for networking and for intellectual  pursuit. Generally I would group these benefits under the following headings:</p>
	  <ol type="a">
	    <li>Fellowship,  including the opportunity to get out of the house every now and again, to meet  new people, to have a good laugh and generally enjoy oneself.</li>
	    <li>Investment.  Yes, I know, it is a dirty word, but it is a reality, so live with it. Show me  a person who does not enjoy snapping up a rarity for next to nothing and I&rsquo;ll  show you a liar.</li>
	    <li>The  pursuit of knowledge. We all enjoy a good puzzle, and besides, research is the  basis of all collecting, and of all good buying. The investment factor again,  you see?</li>
	    </ol>
	  <p>If  these are the three foundation stones of a hobby, what then makes philatelists  so different from, say, collectors of model trains, Royal Doulton china,  Victorian glass or Art Deco design. Nothing, really, which is why there are so  many overlaps between these various interest groups, and which is why, like  philately, other areas of collecting are also reportedly in poor health.</p>
	  <p>Although  there are some notable differences between philatelists and other hobby groups,  there are also some strong commonalities. Take, for example, the fact that most  collections of stamps today also include a strong research component. This  includes the history of a stamp issue, its design and printing, and ultimately  its functional usage. Many collectors also use aesthetic criteria as a basis  for their acquisitions, while others care little about history or aesthetics,  but have a feel for the market-place. The description of a collector can  include any one, or more, of these factors. This means that philately has  potential links to any number of specialised interest groups concerned with the  research of genealogy, local customs, railway infrastructure, social history,  art and artefacts, curiosities, and investment, and might look to all of these  to increase its membership base.</p>
	  <p>So,  if we can agree that philatelists belong to a larger community of collectors;  that many collectors will seek out the company of like-minded beings; that  collectors will collect, at least in part, according to aesthetic preference or  investment; and that the decline in the collector&rsquo;s market in general cannot be  blamed upon the electronic communication media, but upon changing social and  economic circumstances; then we have some sound principles upon which we can  plan our future actions.</p>
	  <p>There  is strong evidence to show that many changes in the collector&rsquo;s market can be  ascribed to the evolving role of women in society, and the changing nature of  marriage and the nuclear family. Greater gender equality in the home and in the  work place has meant that household budgets are no longer under the sole  control of patriarchal males, with unhindered access to its surpluses. This has  limited their buying power, and thus also, their influence in the hobby. It has  also placed moral limitations upon the purchase of expensive collecting items,  the pieces which normally impress juries and gain awards. Most importantly,  however, gender equality has given women access to surpluses of their own,  allowing many of them to play a more prominent role in collecting. But where  are these new women collectors in philately? Quite clearly the hobby remains  patriarchal while women collectors channel their resources into other areas,  such as porcelain dolls, fine silver, jewellery, china and furniture.</p>
	  <p>I strongly believe that one of the  keys to the survival of philately will be our willingness to break this gender  deadlock. This, and our ability to maximise on our strong points, of good  company, investment and intellectual pursuit, might open our doors to new, and  previously unplanned-for recruits. Before this can happen however, we need to  also re-examine our traditional collecting habits, and how these are reinforced  by that annual &ldquo;rite of passage&rdquo;, the National Exhibition, how this is  presided over by a jury usually dominated by men, and the role in this ritual  played by Federation and its system of rewards.</p>
	  <p>There  is no doubt that male collecting is a high testosterone affair, where the rare,  the highly priced and the esoteric play a large role. Collections are evaluated  by rarity (and hence price) factors, and although research does play a role, in  reality most write-ups do not exceed the data obtained from most catalogues or  handbooks. While one cannot underestimate the role that many dealers play in  the running and, indeed, perhaps even survival of the hobby, the conclusion  that their financial well-being is reliant upon their ability to sell highly  priced items on the market is regrettably inescapable. &ldquo;New&rdquo; research,  while highly regarded, is useless unless it is accompanied by material of a &ldquo;respectable&rdquo;  vintage, and while a number of dedicated people dutifully continue to record  the modern and the common for the sake of future and often as-yet-unborn  generations, they have to suffer manfully (another gender specific term) while  dilettanti with obscene budgets are rewarded with national honours. Women who  exhibit nationally are judged by the same standards, that is to say, by how  well they can perform like men.</p>
	  <p>I  believe that most of us, male and female collectors alike, are drawn by what I  have called the &ldquo;Ah! Factor&rdquo;, the visually exciting, the hauntingly  beautiful, the finely drawn, the inspirational and the seldom seen, the item  which stands out in a dealer&rsquo;s box or the auction sale and makes us exclaim &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;  The truth of an &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; item is that we seldom find more than one or two  of them, certainly never enough to fill one frame, let alone a full three or  five frame exhibit. They almost never fit in with our main collecting theme,  but nonetheless we buy them, to hoard and cherish, and occasionally to look  them over. I also believe that men are more regimented in their approach, and  will collect and research a theme, a country, or an issue with single-minded  thoroughness, bringing together the common and rare alike into an exhibit which  often dissects the subject to dreary exhaustion. That is why Federation, its  National Exhibition, and its juries are all dominated by men. Women, on the  other hand, are more guided by the visually stimulating and the socially  responsive, where an item has an underlying subtext which links it to the  people who made it. After 44 years of stamp collecting I now believe that women  are more drawn to the &ldquo;Ah! Factor&rdquo;, and this is why so few of them show  their treasures beyond a society level, or indeed exhibit them at all. Unlike  men, who display their cars, homes, families, mistresses and collections as an  extension of their virility and as a means of defining their social and  economic self, women use their collections discreetly and as an expression of  their private selves.</p>
	  <p>In  this argument, therefore, I advocate a return to &ldquo;original&rdquo; collecting  values, using &ldquo;original&rdquo; as in fifteenth century original rather than in  the sense of a vague &ldquo;dem gooood ol&rsquo; days&rdquo;. Historically, collecting was  not about amassing every known type of butterfly, or animal, or book, but  rather about bringing together objects and artefacts which delighted the  senses, aroused wonder, excited intellectual curiosity, and somehow allow us to  arrive at some conclusion about the human condition. By all means, continue  with the national exhibitions in their present format, after all recognition of  philatelic excellence is an important part of our life, but let us put aside at  least 25% of each exhibition to a non-competitive class called &ldquo;The Printed  Ephemera&rdquo; where non-philatelic visitors can jump from Napoleon&rsquo;s autograph  on one page to a sheet of Indian matchbox covers on the next, where my father&rsquo;s  wartime &ldquo;Permit to Circulate on a Bicycle&rdquo; can sit cheek by jowl with  envelopes scripted in fine Chinese calligraphy and WWI Cinderella labels.  Stamps, at their most basic, are after all just another manifestation of  printed ephemera.</p>
	  <p>Let  us then open our doors to personal journeys of discovery, family histories and  open admissions as to what makes us all tick and sparkle as individuals. Let us  use philately as a base for social understanding and increased fellowship,  where we can safely display our treasures without fear of scorn, or judgemental  mutters about jam labels, or the &ldquo;horrors of Uhuru&rdquo;, or the excesses of  Philatelic Services, or even a predilection by some for first-day covers. I am  quite certain that, like me, many advanced philatelists are also closet FDC  collectors, and although we may never show these at a Philatelic Exhibition,  they still give us a great deal of pleasure.</p>
	  <p>So!  Let us lay siege to the boring, the constricted, and the hide-bound. Let us  return, at least in part, to the innocent days of philately, when national  exhibitions still allowed for the personal, the original and the idiosyncratic.  Let us give stamp exhibitions back to the collectors, and give youth and women  their full and rightful voice. Allow youth to exhibit alongside mature  collectors and not as a separate group. We can still award the mighty  intellects and the gloriously obsessive amongst us: they are, after all, at the  pinnacle of the hobby, but let us also recognise that their lofty perches are  unattainable to most collectors, and are thus intimidating and supremely  uninteresting to all but a small minority. The small and personal collection,  on the other hand, is the common matrix from where all philatelic exhibits  arise, and it is up to us to give them their rightful place in the order of philatelic  things. It is thus and only thus that we can hope to extend the demographic  base of our hobby, and, need it be said, even find future purchasers for our  current collections.</p>
