          MAHAMBA, Swaziland: Society not known, 1840; SPG  1877; WMMS. This report refers to King Mswati II who was also known as Mavuso.  He invited the Rev Allison to establish a mission station at Mahamba in 1844.  The incident mentioned here by Merensky did not take place, as he states, as a  result of Mswati's death, which occurred in 1868, but because the Regent,  Malambule, had retained some of the Royal cattle and, upon being charged of  this fact, had sought refuge with the missionary concerned. The resultant  upheavals brought to an end the first attempt to establish a Mission Station  among the Swazi.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;Three years after the death of king  Rapusa of Swaziland, the missionary Allison and his wife arrived at Matemba,  capital of the Swazis. He founded a station at the Umkonto river. Then a  brother of the young king, Umswazi, contested the accession to the throne and,  in the skirmishes which followed, the mission station, which included the  mission house and the church, was destroyed. Allison and his wife fled to Natal  and founded a mission station at Edendale, near Pietermaritzburg&quot;.</em></p>

          MAKWASSIE, also spelt MAKWASSE and MAQUASSI,  Transvaal: WMMS. It was established by Samuel Broadbent who documented the  building of the Mission house as follows:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;On a representation of these  circumstances to Siffonello, he went with Mr Hodgson to the site chosen for the  new town intended for their settled abode. On their return we were delighted  with Mr Hodgson's description of it, as being a well selected and beautiful  place called Maquassi. In a few days after we struck our tents, and went there.  Having previously learnt the part on which the natives would build their  houses, we selected a site on which to build ours, at a convenient distance  from theirs, so as to be separate and yet accessible. We had some doubts  respecting an adequate supply of water for so large a population, as the  fountain which had been pointed out to us was not very copious. However, as  there was a periodical river at a short distance, at which their cattle would  drink, we supposed that the people would fetch water from it, or that they  probably knew of other springs in the locality not yet seen by us.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;Here, then, we set to work in  earnest, first to collect material with which to construct our habitations. My  case being urgent, induced me to cut down timber, of which there was a  tolerable supply in the neighbourhood, to build a house in the manner of the  natives, though of a different form. The width was limited by the length of  beams we could get, and the length such as admitted of a division into three  parts: one end for a lodging-room, the other end a room of equal size, which  was divided into halves, one for a pantry, the other for books, implements,  etc.; and the centre room, which was the largest, for our sitting and dining  apartment. In building this house, we dug holes in the ground at proper  distances, in which we set up perpendicular posts, well fastened by ramming the  earth in around them. We then placed horizontal beams along the top, and  fastened thee and the rafters with thongs cut from the hides of oxen, which,  being used while soft, became, when dry, hard and firm.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;The intermediate space between the  main posts was filled with smaller spars, crossed with woodbines, and the  squares filled up with clay, which, when dry, was whitewashed within and  without. This kind of work the people performed under my direction; but I and  my wagon-driver had to make the door and window frames, and fix them in the  walls. The whole was covered with thatch made of long grass.&nbsp; For doors and window-shutters we nailed  together the boards of packing cases. I had a view to this when I chose those  cases for my goods when in the colony. Hinges, locks, door latches, etc with  nails and screws, we had taken with us.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;The native women made for us an  excellent floor of material from ant-hills, which they first pounded, then  spread even, and sprinkled with water, after which they, in a kind of dance,  stamped it with their feet, so that, when dry, it was both hard and smooth. Our  lodging-room was first completed, that we might be ready for the expected  addition to our family.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;I made a bedstead of poles and  leather straps, on which was laid our hair mattress, which had served first for  out sea cot, then for our wagon bed. The house was consecrated to God by prayer  and praise.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;We were followed to this place in a  few weeks by Siffonello and his people; first by a party who made folds for  their cattle, then by the whole tribe; and in a short time a populous town was  built&quot;.</em></p>

          MAMRE, Groenekloof, also spelt MAMRA,  Cape: MorG 1808. It was visited by John Campbell in November and December 1812  who reported as follows:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;We visited every Hottentot family in  the settlement, about forty in number. Their houses, though mean huts, were  clean, and their dress, upon the whole was decent, though there were some  exceptions.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;After dinner we took a circuit round  the settlement, calling a several houses of the Hottentots, which were neat and  clean. Some of the houses had four apartments, which were whitened, and had  some articles of furniture: but many other houses were as mean as those I  afterwards saw at Bethelsdorp.&rdquo;</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>James Backhouse who visited it in April  1840 described it as follows:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;We walked with Ludwig Teutsch over  the settlement, which is represented in the annexed etching, and on which there  were about 1,000 (Khoikhoi) and other coloured people. They lived in two wide  streets, with gardens between the rows of houses; one of the streets extended  far to the right beyond the limit of the sketch ... Many of the people had also  considerable pieces of corn-land at a short distance; some of their fields  extended up a neighbouring mountain. Their first habitations were usually of  rushes; they next built hartebeest houses of better quality; and many had  superseded these by neat, comfortable cottages, well built and thatched.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;This station was made over by the  Government, to the Moravians in 1808, as a missionary place for the Hottentots,  etc. Before that time, it was successively occupied as a hunting-station for  the Governor, and a depositary for salt. Several of the original buildings were  still standing, and others had been added, among which was a commodious chapel.  The estate was 4,606 morgens, or nearly 9,200 acres.&rdquo;</em></p>

        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;Numerous villages exist within a  short distance of the Mission-house. Several of the people had been into the  Colony to work; they had been careful of their wages, and had procured cattle,  and returned with them to their own country. Some of them were building  cottages of stone and clay, and most of them were decently clothed&quot;.</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Eugene Casalis visited the Station,  probably in the early 1840s, when he gave the following account of building its  church:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;The churches of which we have spoken  are mostly the work of our converts. At this very moment one is being  completed, to the erection of which they have subscribed a sum of 200l. They  lend still more willingly the aid of their hands, especially if the work is  managed conjointly, and treated as a family matter, in which case the most  wearisome toil is considered in the light of a pleasure.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;At the time of the construction of  the church at Mekuatling, the natives first got together all the stones, and  prepared about 60,000 bricks; the wood for the framework was found in the  mountains, or at the bottom of ravines inaccessible to horses or oxen; it was  brought, as if by magic, by the strong arms of these men. The stubble and  rushes for the roofing had been cut by them at some distance from the station;  the women and girls took upon themselves the duty of conveying it, and they  might be seen every morning following one another, bearing the their heads  large bundles, which they deposited in the yard. It is customary to stitch  these materials to the laths of the roof by means of thongs, and for this  purpose a number of skins were required. All the hunters of the place set off  immediately, and soon returned with a large waggon-full of the skins of the  gnus and zebras of the neighbourhood. Never had war been waged against these  animals with such good conscience. The hunting cry was, &quot;God wills it! God  commands it!&quot; In the evening the hunters assembled, to sing a hymn to the  Creator before retiring to rest.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;Lime is seldom found in this  country, and is used for no other purpose than to whiten the walls of houses.  It is only found in the form of stalactites in grottoes, situated generally at  the mountain-tops. Mr Daumas, after a great deal of research, had discovered a  considerable quantity near a sparkling fountain falling in cascades; but,  unfortunately, very disadvantageously placed for the convenience of the  quarrymen. The lime was taken by storm; a party set out, one fine morning, as  if on an excursion of pleasure. Mr and Mrs Daumas could not resist the  temptation to be of the party. Blocks almost as hard as marble were soon broken  to shivers, and long before sunset there were no fewer than five cart-loads of  lime, which ten strong oxen conveyed successively to the station.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;Last of all, in order that the  construction of the building should be complete, we must add to the happy  labours already mentioned, a contribution in cattle, the sale of which would  enable our colleague to furnish the sacred edifice with suitable benches&quot;.</em></p>

          <p><em>&quot;The Church had at the time three  Missions in Basutoland: one in the south at Mohale's Hoek, under the charge of  the Rev E W Stenson; a second, as the reader already knows, at Sekubu, in the  extreme north, where the Rev T Woodman and his sister were working; and my own  at Thlotse Heights. Of these the first was speedily destroyed; the mission  buildings being rased to the ground, and the very foundation-stone of the  church dug up by the rebels for the sake of the coins known to be enclosed in  it&quot;.</em></p>

        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;Molopolole appeared undeniably the  most picturesque of all the Bechuana towns. Around us were the rocky heights,  most of them absolutely perpendicular in their upper parts, the lower half  being formed of huge masses of rock, thickly wooded on the less abrupt  declivities, and occasionally adorned with some giant aloe; on our right,  overhanging the pass, was the Molopolole rock, with its interesting geological  formation, and between us and the mouth of the defile were fine trees shading  the mission buildings and their little gardens with their tropical growth of  bananas and sugar-canes ... Accepting an invitation from the missionaries, I  paid them a visit, and found that Mr Price had a home that was furnished with  much comfort and considerable taste. It must, however, have been a great  difficulty for him to attain such an amount of domestic civilization. He had  been one of the two missionaries appointed to conduct the mission into the  country of the Makololos; their reverses, however, had been so many, and their  non-success so complete, that they had been obliged to abandon their  undertaking.&nbsp; His associate, Mr Williams,  belonged, like himself and the other missionaries in Kuruman, Taung, Kanya and  Shoshong, to the London Missionary Society; he had been several years in South  Africa, and was now building himself a house. They offered to introduce me to  the king. Accordingly, on the second day after my arrival, we proceeded to  mount the rocky heights on which, like an eagle's nest, stands the part of the  town that is occupied by Sechele and his retinue. Passing the unfinished house  of Mr Williams, we had first to ascend a narrow section of the glen, at the end  of which stood the chapel built by Mr Price, an unpretending edifice, sixty  feet long and twenty-one feet wide, with an aisle and a thatched roof&quot;.</em></p>

          MORIJA, also spelt MORIJAH, Lesotho: P  1833; SME 1841. It was founded by Eugene Casalis who gave extensive accounts of  the mission house as well as its subsequent buildings. Like most other Mission  Stations in southern Africa, Morija also had humble beginnings:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;The next day we began to think about  constructing some kind of shelter. The box of tools that we had brought from  Europe was opened, and my two fellow-workers and myself took each of us a  hatchet and a saw. Plenty of fine trees were to be seen at a little distance  from the place of our encampment.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;Our excellent friend, Mr Gossellin,  who had joined us in the capacity of a missionary artisan, handled with equal  skill the hammer of the stone-cutter and the mattock of the husbandman.&nbsp; By a few encouraging words he raised my  spirits, and prevented Mr. Arbousset from losing heart - he taught us to  husband our strength, and to direct our blows better. The result was that in the  evening, aided by our men, we carried to our encampment an almost sufficient  quantity of stakes and laths for the construction of the modest dwelling, the  erection of which we had planned.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;It was to be nothing more than a  cabin, a little larger than the huts of the natives, and in a few days it was  completed. Some reeds, placed upon four props driven into the ground, received  our mattresses, and an old table and some trunks completed the furniture. The  guns and the implements of husbandry were suspended like trophies from certain  projecting points, which our primitive columns presented at very irregular  intervals. It was so long since we had seen anything resembling a human  habitation, that this poor cabin threw us into an ecstasy of admiration.</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>In spite of having expert building  assistance not all their structures stood the test of the African weather.  Casalis tells of one such mishap:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;We had heard so much of the  scorching climate of Africa, and had been so earnestly recommended to fix our  abode near streams adapted to the purpose of irrigation, that we never imagined  we should experience any inconvenience from rain. There could surely be no more  than passing showers. The roof of our cabin consisted of a thin layer of reeds,  bound rather loosely to the rafters which formed their support; the rafters  themselves were not sufficiently slanting to cause the water to run off  quickly, and the consequence was, the first heavy shower we had produced upon  us the effect of a shower-bath. This amused us very much - it was, doubtless,  an accidental occurrence. But week after week these shower-baths became more  frequent and more copious, and we at length determined to give the entire  surface of our roof a coat of mortar. The remedy aggravated the evil; the  rafters gave way under the weight, and soon, instead of an umbrella, we had a  funnel over our heads&quot;.</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Eventually a new Mission house became  necessary. Casalis continued his account:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;During these hours of inactivity and  of compulsory fasting we devised the plan of a solid stone house, twenty-four  feet by eighteen, which was to contain five rooms and a large kitchen. The  first stone was laid with great ceremony. One may judge of the serious nature  of this undertaking by the reflection which it suggested to my companion, Mr.  Arbousset. The day the stone was laid he wrote as follows:</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;Without adopting the opinion of an  author of much celebrity and without applying to the evangelical Missionary  what that writer has said of the priest, we nevertheless believe that he ought,  in some way, to command respect; and experience has proved that a grave  demeanour, a spacious dwelling, order in the domestic arrangements, and  cleanliness in everything, are at least some of the means which favourably  prepossess the simple and uninstructed mind.&quot;</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;Alas! how matter-of-fact we become  as we grow old! Now, my friend, would say that he built the house for the  preservation of his health.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;Ours were evidently in great danger.  Colds, rheumatism, and fevers of all kinds, would have been the natural results  of our almost aquatic life, and yet we had nothing of the kind; we had never  been better in our lives; a loving and all-powerful Father was watching over  us, and He did not permit us to suffer the natural consequences of our  inexperience. &quot;We laboured for six months, without any relaxation, at our  new dwelling, and were in such a hurry to enter it, that we installed ourselves  before the roof was completed, or a single door put up. The Basutos watched our  proceedings, and asked each other why, if we wanted a cavern, we did not go and  inhabit one of those which abound in the Malutis?&quot;</em></p>
          <p><em>Casalis also gave a description of an  ideal Mission Station, but could possibly have been referring to his home at  Moriah.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;Turn your eyes from these silent scenes  to seek the station. You will discover at the foot of a hill, in the shadow  cast by the mountain nearest you, a few simple, though well-built houses, whose  white fronts are turned towards large orchards and cultivated fields. You will  recognise, by its size and isolated position, the edifice consecrated to the  worship of God.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;A little higher up are seen several  small buildings, in rough stone (pretty well arranged in a row), whose  principal charm consists in their being overshadowed by some very fine peach-trees:  these are the dwellings of those of the inhabitants who have taken the first  step towards civilisation. Higher up still may be seen immense circles, the  circumference of which is composed of huts or an oval form, and placed very  near each other: this is the motse, the heathen community, where barbarous  songs may too often be heard; whilst lower down the inhabitants meet, morning  and evening, to chant the praises of the Saviour.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;Perhaps, after this glance at the  ensemble of our station, you would like to enter one of our African churches.  They are generally very much crowded, and it is sometimes not without  difficulty that the preacher makes his way to the pulpit. The Christian women  dress on a Sunday much as our villagers do; but they seem to understand that a  handkerchief, worn as a turban, suits their dark complexion and rustic nature  infinitely better than a bonnet or a cap; the men prefer a paletot to a jacket,  and a frock to a tail-coat, which latter they consider as supremely ridiculous;  the greater number still prefer arraying themselves in their cloaks of skins,  and the Missionaries are not over-exacting in this particular&quot;.</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Morija was visited by James Backhouse in  July 1839 who recorded the following:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;The rain increased as we approached  Morija, which is situated under a lofty range of hills, and near a remarkable  peak, called Thabe Tele. The settlement is represented in the accompanying cut.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;It is, in what may properly be  called the Basutu country; it consists of the mission premises, and two large  kraals; the latter are situated on natural terraces, on the side of an adjacent  mountain.&nbsp; There are also many smaller  kraals in the vicinity&quot;.</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Subsequent to his original descriptions of  Morija, published in 1861, Casalis was to provide more detailed accounts of his  home in 1889. The building of the Mission Station he described as follows:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;For the moment what most interested  us in this wood was the wood itself.&nbsp; We  needed a shelter with the least possible delay. One could be quickly extemporised  with stakes and branches; but we wanted to render these materials amenable to  the plumb-line and the square. We had remarked, not without anxiety, that in  this country almost all the trees preferred bifurcations, and all sorts of  grotesque protuberances, to a vertical growth. We found, however, amongst the  younger ones, a certain number which answered our requirements.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;The next day we cut down as many as  we needed, and the cabin was nearly finished in the week. It was worth about  what it had cost us. Never was improvised domicile less comfortable. No groom  would have accepted it for his horses. But Gossellin, our master in this line  of things, was reserving himself for the masonry, which was his strong point.  We were going by-and-by to have buildings altogether irreproachable. 'This is  merely provisional', said he. That word answered for everything. He coldly  added, 'The little house is good enough for those who have to live in it'.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;As we were finishing it, we saw  coming towards us a squad of young fellows from eighteen to twenty years of  age, commanded by Molapo, the second son of Moshesh. They were the assistants  whom he had promised us. They soon established themselves, putting up some huts  after their fashion, which they adorned inside with their shields, placing  along the walls, by way of pillars, sacks of sorgho or large millet&quot;.</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Improvements of the Morija Mission soon  became necessary, as Casalis was to report:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;It may be imagined with what joy my  friends saw me arrive. I found them in perfect health, and full of spirits.  They had improved the cabin.&nbsp; Such as it  had now become it might have contended a not too particular coast-guardsman or  tide-waiter. There were three compartments in it: one in front, which served as  sitting room; another, a little larger, which formed the bed and dressing room;  and, in addition, a small chamber for out boxes, tools, bags, etc. In this last  a prominent feature was a huge cord hanging from a beam with a hook at the end.  It was there we hung the piece of game, or the sheep killed for the weekly  consumption. There were neither windows nor wooden doors. Some holes, which we  could at need stop up with our oldest hats, allowed just enough light to  penetrate to allow us to read without too much difficulty. For ingress and  egress we had an arrangement of strong wattles pivoting on a wooden  socket&quot;.</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Three years later Casalis reported on  forther improvements:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;The labours of the first three years  were extremely fatiguing. The hardest came first; those demanded by the  preparation of materials of construction. During entire months we were doing  nothing except hewing stones, working lumps of clay for bricks, with our  trousers turned up to the knees, cutting down trees, and sawing them into beams  and planks. Of all our work nothing was so tiring as this last. We understood  absolutely nothing of sawyering, and our instrument being an English one, that  is, an immense flexible blade, unmounted, it was especially difficult to  manage. It was continually getting out of the track, to the right or left, and  once out of the right line it would have been easier to break it than to get it  to move an inch. It was necessary then to have recourse to all sorts of  expedients; to turn and return spite of its weight, the unfortunate tree-trunk  we were handling so awkwardly. At times one might have seen us all three  stretched on our backs, exhausted, quite out of breath, and asking ourselves if  our vertebral column would ever recover from such a strain. The natives would  look at us with open mouths, seeking vainly to comprehend the view of life  which could lead men to kill them-selves to provide so simple an affair as a  shelter from the sun and rain. The reflections they made did not prevent our  young natives from lending us a hand when we asked them. The son of the chief  went to work as eagerly as the rest. They burst into shouts of laughter when  they found they had misunderstood the directions we gave them, or had made some  blunder. Their good humour helped to keep up ours.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;There were certain kinds of work at  which they were very apt. They were handy at the spade, and we were able to  make good use of them in the cultivation of our plants. They were useful also  in raising rough stone or mud walls. Thanks to their help, we were enabled,  without much interruption in the preparation of our materials of construction,  to substantially wall in our cattle enclosure and our garden&quot;.</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Finally though it became necessary to  erect a larger Mission House. On 17 September 1834 Casalis reported on its  completion:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;September 17th, 1834, saw our large  house at Moriah nearly finished. The roof was on, and it was secured against  winds and wild beasts by doors and windows. We celebrated the occasion by a  thanksgiving service and the killing of a fat ox, with which to regale the  young men who had been our assistants.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;We determined at first to use only  three rooms, the other part being devoted to the Sunday services and to our  first attempts at a school. We were by this means enabled to put off to a later  date the erection of a chapel and schoolhouse. This respite was indispensable  to us: we were wearied of hewing stones, of making bricks, and of sawing wood.</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>As Casalis noted, these structures were  not always successful in excluding rainwater:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;The rain stopped us to such an  extent that Fossellin had to leave me before the cabin was quite finished. The  storms which forces us to strike work at Thaba-Bossiou had caused him to lose  some thousands of bricks which he had moulded at Moriah, and had demolished a  large portion of the wall of a school then in construction&quot;.</em></p>

        <p>MORLEY, also known as NEW MORLEY and MALE,  Mqanduli, Cape: WMS 1830. This mission was originally established at AMADOLA  in 1828 but was attacked and burnt down a year later by refugees from the  Difaqane. In 1830 it was removed to OLD MORLEY, also known locally as WILO,  where it remained until 1863 when it was resited once again to a new location  13km nearer the coast. This then became known as NEW MORLEY or, more  simply, as MORLEY. OLD MORLEY subsequently became a trading  station. It was visited by James Backhouse in March 1839 who reported as  follows:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;Morley is a flourishing Station. Its  population was at this time about 300, but on First-days, nearly twice the  number attended the chapel. Nineteen men and seventeen women were members of  the church.&nbsp; The pupils in the school  were about 100. Forty-five were in attendance, exclusive of little children,  notwithstanding many were occupied in watching the gardens. The schoolmaster  was a native. The little children were taught the alphabet in a (Xhosa) hut;  the school for older children was kept in the chapel.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;A few of the men here had learned to  fell and saw timber, and to assist in building. The Mission-house was a neat,  brick building; in front of it a few shrubs were inclosed within a fence. A  brick house was in course of erection for the Catechist. The chapel was  likewise a brick building. Two cottages of wattle-and- dab were occupied by the  Catechist and others connected with the mission. The Interpreter had erected  for himself a wattle-and-dab cottage, of two rooms, with a chimney and a  four-paned window. The window was given to him as an encouragement for building  his house with a chimney. A few other (Xhosa) were building cottages. The  (Xhosa) huts on the station were numerous; they were of larger dimensions than  those in many other places. Wood and grass are abundant here, rain being  frequent&quot;.</em></p>

          MOSHANENG, Botswana: WMMS. It was visited by Emil  Holub in 1873 when he recorded the following:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;The southern part of Moshaneng  belonged to Molema and his Barolongs, and (excepting the ruined church and Mr  Martin's house) contained no buildings in the European style of architecture.  The native huts were all of pure Bechuana construction, and owing to the  limited space, were packed very closely together, although in the Baharutse  quarter, separated by a valley and a stream, the farmsteads were much less  crowded. I should estimate the population of the entire town to be about 7000;  but out of this number nearly 1000 would be fluctuating, many of the  inhabitants working occasionally for lengthened periods at the diamond fields,  or cultivating land at a distance.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;The king's residence stood in the  western part near the river-bank and was surrounded by a courtyard containing  two huts apiece for his five wives&quot;.</em></p>

        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;Motito, which is represented in the  accompanying cut, is situated about ten miles west of the low, conical hill of  Takoon, from which Old Lattakoo took its name. After that station was deserted,  in consequence of invasion by some native hordes, the Missionaries of the Paris  Society re-occupied it, but they subsequently removed to Motito, on account of  the latter place being better supplied with water. The most remote house in the  cut is the mission-house, the nearer ones are a chapel and a store. They are  built of raw brick&quot;.</em></p>

        <p>MOUNT ARTHUR,  Glen Grey, Cape: LMS 1840; WMS 1853; SafMS 1862. This station was previously  known as the BUSHMAN SCHOOL, the BUSHMAN STATION, FREEMANTON  and FREEMANTLE. It was visited by Thomas Baines in 1848 who he recorded  one of the Mission's outstations as follows:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;Upon the projecting ridge pole of  the Chief's house, a rough framework loosely thatched with reeds of ten to  fourteen feet in length, hung three pair of hartebeest horns ... Passing  through the village, which consisted of perhaps half a dozen reed houses  similar but inferior to that of the Chief, we outspanned beyond the building  that served as a school and chapel ...&quot;</em></p>

        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;We saw them building a large &amp;  elegant house fitting up in the first style, for which extravagance I suppose  poor John Bull contributed pretty handsomely&quot;.</em></p>
          <p><em>By the time Backhouse visited this mission  in March 1939 it was in ruins.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;Mount Coke, like most other places  in this country, bore marks of the devastations of war. The old mission-house,  which was of stone, was in ruins, and there were but few inhabitants left upon  the place. Some of these were living in huts of wattle-and-dab, of which  material the unfinished houses of the Missionary and Catechist, and a rude  building, without doors or windows, used as a chapel, were also  constructed&quot;.</em></p>

        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;Near Imparani, there were several  remarkable peaks, and tabular sandstone mountains; the villages of the natives  were very numerous on the rocky slopes of the latter. On the plains, the  corn-fields of the people were extensive. We passed through the werf or town of  the Chief, Sikoniela, which consisted of numerous huts, with courts of reed  fencing, just as the people, were bringing in the cattle in the evening, and  soon came in sight of the white chapel and mission-house, where we met a hearty  welcome from James Allison, whose valuable wife was gone to Grahams Town on  account of her health. The people of Imparani are Mantatees.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;The Mantatees cultivated a  considerable quantity of land in this neighbourhood. From the time that their  grain came up, they employed many of their children in herding their cattle, to  keep them off their cultivated ground, which is universally unfenced. James  Allison showed them the advantage of fencing their ground, by building a stone  wall around his own garden, which was in front of his house&quot;.</em></p>

          MPOKANE, also spelt UMPUKANI, OFS, but may  have been in Lesotho: Probably PMS c1836. Visited by Arbousset and Daumas in  1836 (pp 22-23), who recorded it to have been a mission to Koranna Khoikhoi and  Bastards. They described it as follows:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;On the brow of the hill stand two  European houses; to the right is a kraal of about two hundred and fifty koranna  huts; to the left is a pretty fountain, which can be turned in to water the garden  of the mission house when necessary.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins, who formerly  resided at Old Buchap, founded the station of Umpukani, about three years  before our visit. In the choice of a locality, as well as in the construction  of the houses of the station, they have manifested a prudence and an industry  which might well serve as models for all missionaries in South Africa placed in  similar circumstances. They have erected, at little expense, a dwelling, which  is at once simple and commodious, and is not altogether devoid of elegance. The  house is built of raw bricks; and the erection, serving for chapel and for  school, is formed of reeds, and is covered within and without with a coat of  clay. The garden, although very plain, is well cultivated, and produces the  principal vegetables of the country.&nbsp; In  one corner of this little enclosure, stands Mr. Jenkins' study&quot;.</em></p>
