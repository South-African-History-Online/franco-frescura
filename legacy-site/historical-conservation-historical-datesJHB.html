In July 1904 control of the Tramway Company passed to  the Johannesburg &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Municipality.<br />

	    May 28:  A swarm of locust descended upon Johannesburg.<br />
	    June 11:  The first telephone line came into operation, linking Johannesburg  to Pretoria.<br />

This plant was in operation until 1920 when new works were  completed at &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cottesloe.<br />
	    1892, September 14: The first train from the Cape reached Johannesburg.<br />
	    1893, February: Outbreak of smallpox epidemic in Johannesburg. The incidence of the disease  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;increased steadily from April onwards and only began to play itself out towards  the end of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the year.<br />
	    1894, February 8: A bye-law was passed prohibiting &quot;Natives&quot; from  using the Johannesburg  city's &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pavements.<br />

	    1896, February 19: A shunting locomotive reversed into two railway trucks  containing 1955 tons &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of dynamite on a siding in Braamfontein. The resultant  explosion leveled the nearby &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;residential areas of Braamfontein, Vrededorp,  Fordsburg and the Malay Location. After a &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;week of clearing up, 78 bodies and  four boxes of human remains were recovered. One of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the oft-voiced grievances of  the Uitlander community against the Kruger Government was &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the existence of a &quot;Dynamite  Monopoly&quot;. This was awarded to a German, Edward Lippert, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who obtained  sole concession from the ZAR to manufacture dynamite locally. In fact the  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dynamite was not local, being imported from Germany. It was also not of a high  quality, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;being very unstable. Johannesburg's  &quot;Great Dynamite Explosion&quot;, as it became known, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;only served to  emphasize Uitlander complaints.<br />

Johannesburg was raised to the status of a  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;town.<br />
	    1898, June 30: The new Rissik Street Post Office was opened.<br />
	    1899, October 11: Outbreak of hostilities between Britain and the ZAR.<br />
	    1900, April 25: Johannesburg  was shaken by a large explosion, as the local plant of Begbie's Iron &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foundry  was sabotaged. This was an important contributor to the Republican War effort.<br />
	    1900, May 31: Johannesburg surrendered to the  British when Dr Friederick Krause, Military &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commandant of the Witwatersrand,  handed the keys of the town to Field Marshal Lord &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roberts.

	    1903, May: The Rand Water Board was established<br />
	    1903, November: Elections were held for Johannesburg's  first Municipal Council. The &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Johannesburg Insanitary Area Improvement Scheme  Commission tabled its report. This &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;led to the expropriation of the area now  known as Newtown.  The area of Johannesburg  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was increased to 81.5 square miles.<br />
	    1904, March 19: An outbreak of bubonic plague at the Johannesburg Brickfields  led to the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;removal of its residents to Klipspruit.

	    1913, July 4: A strike meeting was called in Market Square. The Government attempted  to &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prohibit the gathering after it had begun and scuffles broke out between  police and miners. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police were severely assaulted after strikers attacked  them with stones. Workers then &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;attempted to close the tramways, the power  station and the railways. Park Station was &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;attacked and partly burnt down. The  offices of The Star, a strongly pro-management &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;newspaper, were similarly  attacked and gutted by fire.<br />
	    1913, July 5: Unrest continued with minor clashes taking place at various  points of the town's &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;centre.

	    1924:  Work was begun on extensions to Western   Native Township,  involving an additional 1000 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;houses. This project was completed in 1927.<br />

	    1927:  The Johannesburg Town Council appointed Graham Ballenden as Manager of Native  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Affairs.

	    1930:  The number of houses built at Western and Eastern Townships now reached a total  of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2625. In terms of an amendment to the Native (Urban Areas) Act,  additional powers were &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;granted to Local Authorities in regard to the housing of  Blacks. The Johannesburg City &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Council acquired 1300 morgen on the Farm  Klipspruit No 8 for the purpose of building &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;housing for Blacks. This purchase  was made during the so-called Depression, when there &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were still vacant  houses at Western   Native Township.  A competition was held for the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;planning of a township designed to accommodate  80,000 persons. The township was &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;called Orlando  after the then Chairman of the Native Affairs Committee, Orlando Leake. At &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this  time many Blacks were living in such places as Newclare, Sophiatown, Martindale  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Prospect Township, in heavily overcrowded  conditions.<br />

	    1939, September 6: South Africa  declared war on Germany,  three days after Britain.  During the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;next five years influx control regulations were relaxed. Growing  opportunities for work &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;attracted many rural Black families, including their  children, to Johannesburg.  Owing to a &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scarcity of funds, only 873 new houses were built and a further 358  beds were provided in &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hostels. As a result informal settlements began to spring  up around Johannesburg.  It was &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;estimated that, eventually, up to 60,000 people were housed in such  areas.<br />
	    1944:  4042 breeze block shelters were erected in an area known as &quot;Shantytown&quot;,  located &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;between Orlando East and Orlando West.<br />

	    1954:  The Johannesburg Municipality created the Housing  Division as a separate department, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with AJ Archibald as its first Director. Johannesburg submitted an application to the Bantu  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Services Levy Fund for finances to build a direct access road to Soweto. The South &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;African  Railways who, at the time, held a monopoly on transport to this area, opposed  this &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;application.<br />
	    1955:  A Resettlement Board was formed to undertake removal of Blacks from Johannesburg's &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;western  areas. This followed the Johannesburg City Council&rsquo;s refusal to approve the  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;removal of freehold land rights from property owners in Sophiatown.<br />
	    1955, February: Over 60,000 persons living in Johannesburg's western areas,  including &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sophiatown, were removed from their homes at gun-point, in a massive  military-style &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;operation, and were resettled in an area which has since become  known as Soweto. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sophiatown was razed to the ground and, having been renamed  &quot;Triumph&quot;, was given over &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to White, predominantly Afrikaner,  low-income housing.<br />

These funds proved sufficient to build 14,000 homes, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and  the residents of Moroka and Shantytown were subsequently resettled there.<br />
