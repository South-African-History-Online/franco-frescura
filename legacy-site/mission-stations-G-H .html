        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;We used sun-dried bricks made by the  men from inferior clay. Working with clay is usually women's work. The houses  were built on a rocky hill, with the foundations laid straight onto the rocks  and the walls built with sun-dried bricks. The people made bricks and fired them  (in order to build a Mission chapel)&quot;.</em></p>

          GEALEKA  MISSIONS, Cape: see  WILLOWVALE, Cape<br />
          GENADENDAL, also known as HERNHUTH and BAVIAAN'S  KLOOF, Cape: MorG 1736; abandoned in 1744, restarted in 1792; MMS Trade  School. It was visited by Henry Lichtenstein in 1803 (p 189), who reported as  follows:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>&quot;The same year (1799) the Brethren  built a very neat church, from remittances sent <em>them by the society in Europe,  and the number of their disciples now amounts to nearly eleven hundred. Two  hundred houses and huts, with gardens annexed to them, and built in regular  rows, give this place the appearance of an European village; a sight which  surprised me exceedingly, and for the first time brought in a lively manner to  my mind the idea of my native country. Excepting this place, I never saw any  thing in the whole colony bearing the least resemblance to a German  village&quot;.</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Lichtenstein also commended extensively on the buildings at  Genadendal (pp 190-3):</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;The next morning every different  part of the institution was shewn to us; the church in the first place. It is a  simple, neat quadrangular edifice, but the roof is too steep, and carried up to  too sharp a ridge: this was done to give height to the building, and render it  more conspicuous. Within are two rows of benches, and a simple pulpit; the  utmost simplicity is, indeed, observable in every part of the building, but at  the same time the due proportions are exceedingly well observed, and the  workmanship is extremely neat. The timbers are all of sumach wood, the yellow  tint and polish of which gives a sort of simple elegance to the appearance of  the whole. The English government gave the Brethren permission to cut down as  much timber as they wanted from the woods belonging to the company, free of  expense.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;By the side of the church is the  garden of the pastors, in the midst of which stands the large old pear-tree,  planted by Schmidt himself, the original founder of the institution: benches  are standing under its shade, and this is a favourite place of resort among the  Brethren.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;The house inhabited by the Brethren  has, besides the hall in which they assemble, and where they take their meals,  two chambers for two of the couples, and various household conveniences; the  other three couple lodge in small houses close by. Another house is  appropriated to the manufacture of knives, of which Kuhnel is the director, and  which begins already to be very profitable.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;Marsveld is the miller and has built  a water-mill after the European manner, in which he grinds not only all the  corn for the household and the Hottentots, but a great deal for the  neighbouring colonists.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;The church, with the nearest houses,  lie in the deepest recess of the valley, at the foot of the Bavianskloof, from  which, in winter, the water sometimes rushes with great force, so that it has  more than once overflowed the whole valley. The channel has, therefore, been  lately enclosed between two strong walls, and several bridges have been made  over it: a work of no small labour, and affording an additional proof of the  industry and activity of these people. The Brethren proposed carrying this  canal on as a benefit to the lands lying without the valley, and when two years  after I visited this spot, for the last time, it was already extended six  hundred paces farther&quot;.</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Genadendal was also visited by William  Burchell in 1811 when he recorded the following:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;To every philanthropist it could not  fail to be a treat of the prest kind; to witness a despised and degraded  portion of his fellow-creatures taken under the kind protection of those who  have had the more fortunate lot of being born to the improvements of European  knowledge; to behold them thus reclaimed from disgusting filthiness, to a  decent cleanliness; from a wild, irregular life, to order and social rules;  from uninstructed stupidity, to a knowledge and practice of morality and the  useful arts of civilised man; in fine, from a gross ignorance of the Supreme  Being, to a due sense of the superintending goodness of the Great Creator of  the universe. When missionary labors produce effects such as these, every  well-wisher of mankind will view them with respect. Such, at least, are the  professed objects of this institution; and if some instances are to be found,  which show that they have not in every case been attained, and that seed sown  on a sterile soil has been unproductive, we are not on that account to shut our  eyes against the many proofs of the utility of such an establishment as  Genadendal. Every one acquainted with human nature, will be ready to acknowledge,  that many difficulties must be overcome in the course of such an attempt. To  inculcate the necessity of honest industry, as a chief moral duty, is in effect  cutting off the root of, at least, half the miseries of the Hottentot race, and  tends to make these people a more valuable part of the population of the  colony. Their general quiet and harmless character gives them a superior claim  to encouragement, and renders them friendly to the exiting government&quot;.</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The dwellings of the Khoikhoi also evicted  some comment from Burchell in 1811:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;The Vignette at the end of this  chapter is a view of a part of the valley of Genadendal, showing the ordinary  huts of the Hottentots, surrounded by plantations of peach-trees. The mountain  there seen is part of Zwarteberg.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;The huts at Genadendal, unlike those  of genuine Hottentot construction, which have an hemispherical shape, and are  covered with mats, are merely a rude imitation of the quadrangular buildings of  the colonists. Those which we saw, were generally from ten to fifteen feet  long, and from eight to ten wide, having an earthen floor, and walls  white-washed on their inside, composed of rough unhewn posts, filled up between  with reeds and rushes plastered with mud, and the whole covered with a roof of  thatch. The eaves being in general not higher from the ground than four or six  feet, the doors could not be entered without stooping. A small unglazed window  admitted light; but there was neither chimney, nor any other opening in the  roof, by which the smoke might escape.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;Some of the huts exhibited superior  workmanship, being divided by a partition wall into two rooms, and were  exceedingly neat and clean. A table, two or three chairs, and a box, all  manufactured by the Hottentots themselves, made up the principal part of the  furniture. A few families, who had been long established here, lived in houses  of a much better description, built of square sawn beams, and walls partly of  bricks and partly of mud hardened in the sun. One house, situated in a line of  huts called Molen-straat (Mill-street), contained a small hand-mill, where  three Hottentots were busily employed in grinding their corn.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;This mill was remarkable for its  very simple construction: the essential parts of its mechanism where merely two  horizontal stones, of two feet in diameter, and three handles. The under-stone  was fixed, about three feet from the ground, in a circular frame or box of  wood, elevated above it high enough to prevent the upper stone, when in motion,  from flying off. The inner surface of each stone was channelled in the same  manner as we observe in the mill-stones in England; while the upper on was  perforated by a funnel-shaped hole of the form of an inverted cone, into which  the corn, in small quantities, was continually thrown by hand. In the upper  surface of the moving stone was fixed a stout cylindric pin of iron. The handle  was a horizontal stick about four feet long, one end of which was fastened by a  piece of raw hide to the iron pin; while the other was supported by ropes suspended  from different parts of the roof. By alternately pushing forward and pulling  back these handles, the upper stone was made to turn round with any desired  degree of velocity, and at the same time discharged the flour by a spout in the  side of the circular box. The greatest inconvenience of such a mill consists in  its having no means for regulating the degree of fineness or coarseness of the  meal; but for this country, where regular millwrights are seldom to be found,  it possesses a most important advantage, in being so easy of construction, that  every farmer may make one for himself. It is, in fact, often to be met with in  the houses of the boors, having, most probably, been by them originally  introduced into this colony&quot;.</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Burchell also commented on how Genadendal's  women augmented their incomes by manufacturing reed mats:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;The women here, besides all their  domestic employments, earn a little money by the sale of mats, which they  manufacture from a kind of rush, very common in the rivers of this district.  These rushes are sometimes so long as to admit of being made into mats six feet  in width: this is not done in the manner of interweaving, but by placing them  parallel to each other, and transversely with respect to the length of the mat,  connecting them at every five or six inches by cords, made either of the same  material, or of the bark of the Karoo thorn-tree, run through them the whole  length of the mat, by means of a long wooden or bone needle&quot;.</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>A year later, on 30 December 1812, John  Campbell was to give this description:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;Genadendal was full in view before  us. Their large church was very conspicuous at a distance. The settlement lies  at the end of a valley, closely surrounded, except in one direction, with great  mountains. At a distance it has more the appearance of a garden than a town. As  we passed the houses, we were gratified by the civilized appearance of many of  the Hottentots, although others were dressed in their loose sheepskins. They  saluted us in a friendly manner, and the children seemed highly diverted to see  us moving along. At length we arrived at the houses of the missionary brethren,  where we were received with much christian affection. A more pleasant spot than  that in which they dwell can hardly be imagined; ...</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;At eight o'clock we repaired to  their chapel, which will contain upwards of a thousand people, every part of  which was filled with Hottentots&quot;.</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>In about 1833 Eugene Casalis visited  Genadendal and reported as follows:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;After some fatiguing stages I  reached Gnadenthal on the hottest day I ever remember, which is saying much.  Towards mid-day I found myself at the entrance of a narrow valley which widened  further down, and a murmur of running waters saluted my ears. Soon, on both  sides of the road, appeared some small well-kept houses surrounded by fruit  trees and vegetable gardens. Women, with woolly hat and yellow complexions,  were to be seen through the windows occupied in various households duties. At  each turn of the road I remarked that the cottages became more and more like  houses.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;Suddenly, while I was occupied in  examining a kind of public square and the outlines of a steeple which appeared  in the distance, he stopped me. 'Here', said he, 'is the place where our  pastors, the Moravian Brethren, desire strangers to stop and refresh themselves  before going to salute them'.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;I was promptly installed in an airy  whitewashed chamber, whose walls were somewhat darkened by the foliage of some  fine shrubs planted before the windows. There were in it some chairs, a table  covered with a white cloth, a bed, and everything requisite for copious  ablutions.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;When the repast was finished the  bishop invited me to come with him and have a look round the station. What a  contrast with the primitive Hottentot village! I found myself in a kind of  square, all the buildings of which were occupied by the families of the  missionaries, except the schools and depots containing the products of the  common industry. These houses, painted yellow, to modify the effect of the sun,  were surrounded with trees of dense foliage. In the middle of the square was a  fine church, seating nearly 2000 people, and surmounted by a light spire.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;M. Teutsch took me first to the  schools. They were three in number: one for the infants; the others for the  boys and the girls. The master and the mistresses were Hottentots. They taught  in Dutch and English together, the Hottentot language having disappeared with  the nationality of the old possessors of the country.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;In passing out of the central square  the plash of a fountain attracted my attention. It fell into a reservoir, where  women were busy washing linen. There was no lack of soap, which was made at the  station. A little further on some immense wheels, placed under the weir,  furnished motive power for the corn and cutlery mills. I was glad to buy one or  two of those knives whose finely-tempered steel are so much appreciated by the  colonists of the Cape, and which are known by the name of Herrn-hunters. To  these industries are added a sawmill, and the works where are constructed those  heavy rolling structures so often described under the name of Cape wagons. In  all these workshops the sole artisans are Hottentots, directed by the  missionaries.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;My guide now conducted me across  some kitchen gardens, orchards, and well-cultivated wheat fields, until we  arrived before an iron grating, above which were written the words, 'They are  sown in corruption'. It was the cemetery of Gnadenthal.&rdquo;</em></p>

          GERLACHSHOOP, also spelt GERLATHSHOOP,  Transvaal: Bn 1904. It was formerly known as RIETKLOOF. Alexander  Merensky reported as follows:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;Gerlachshoop Mission Station was  established next to Maleo's town, fifteen German miles out of Lydenburg, on  land donated by the chief.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;The first thing we had to do was to  rebuild the water channel, which was 1500 paces long, a task which took  fourteen days. Other labourers erected thornbush fences for a kraal and I began  a log house, the kind of dwelling we always erect first on a new mission  station. Other houses whose walls consisted of sods, followed. Log structures  last quite well as long as they are built with termite-resistant wood. Four  corner posts are put into the ground, and thinner posts for the walls are  places in between. Horizontal poles are then nailed and bound to them.&nbsp; (A horizontal beam placed at about eaves  height would have been necessary in order to make this structure work as  described: Editor). Reeds are filled in vertically and finally dagga is packed  in and smeared inside and out. The walls and the dagga floor are smoothed. The  roof consists of lightweight beams and is thatched. Our houses measured 8 by 4  paces; my little window was closed with a fixed piece of cloth but the door was  left open. At the river, where we found usable clay, we started a brickyard  with some natives who had learned the trade during their years as migrant  labourers. We constructed the stone moulds and stone kilns and got to work  erecting a larger house with fired bricks. Lime is used only as a whitewash,  because it is so difficult to get. We fired some limestone, which had been  carted in from a site 5 hour's away, in an open kiln. With this lime, used as a  mortar, we laid a brick foundation to prevent termites from reaching the  woodwork of the walls and roof. Alas, within a year, the thatched roof was  infested, but this stopped at the end of the beams in the corner of the house.  We had dipped the beam ends into aloe sap and the trusses were of termite  resistant wood&quot;.</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Missionary endeavours at Gerlachshoop also  involved the transmission of building skills to the local population. The  missionary body obviously shouldered the &quot;white man's burden&rdquo; with  a sense of responsibility:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;We taught our workers to lay bricks  ... The missionary learns to understand the natives, their customs and  character, by working alongside them at mundane tasks, such as those neccessary  to permit a station to be self-sufficient in housing and food production.  German artisans, sent out to establish the mission station, were of no great  help. They regarded the natives as servants and frequently misunderstood them.  The natives in turn would become bitter and suspicious towards the  missionaries&quot;.</em></p>

        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;Not far from here, is the spot where  these missionaries first established themselves in 1801, at a place called  Aakaap by the Hottentots, or Rietfontein (Reed Fountain) in Dutch. They  afterwards removed to The Kloof, but finally fixed their head-quarters at  Klaarwater, as being a situation more central with respect to the different  out-posts, or kraals, occupied by this race of Hottentots.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;I accompanied the three missionaries  round the village, to take a cursory view of the different parts of it; the  huts of the Hottentots, their own dwellings; the house for religious meeting  and school instruction1; their storehouse, and their garden. When I considered  that this little community, and the spot on which I stood, were nearly eight  hundred miles deep in the interior of Africa, I could not but look upon every  object of their labors with double interest; and received, at that moment a  pleasure, unalloyed by the knowledge of a single untoward circumstance. The  Hottentots peeped out of their huts to have a look at me; and I fancied they  appeared glad at having one more white man amongst them.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;The above engraving is a view of the  Church. The furthest building is the dwelling-house of one of the missionaries;  and the intermediate hut is a storehouse. Beyond these is shown a part of the  ridge, which is represented at the head of Chapter 20.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;From the moment when I decided on  making Klaarwater in my way to the Interior, I naturally endeavured to form, in  my own mind, some picture of it; and I know not by what mistake it arose, that  I should conceive the idea of its being a picturesque spot surrounded by trees  and gardens, with a river running through a neat village, where a tall church  stood, a distant beacon to mark that Christianity had advanced thus far into  the wilds of Africa. But the first glance now convinced me how false may  oftentimes be the notions which men form of what they have not seen. The trees  of my imagination vanished, leaving nothing in reality but a few which the  missionaries themselves had planted; the church sunk to a barn-like building of  reeds and mud; the village was merely a row of half a dozen reed cottages; the  river was but a rill; and the situation an open, bare, and exposed place,  without any appearance of a garden, excepting that of the missionaries.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;It would be very unfair towards  those who have devoted themselves to a residence in a country, where they are  cut off from communication with civilized society, and deprived of all its  comforts, to attribute this low state of civilization and outward improvement,  to a want of solicitude on their part. Their continual complaint, indeed, was  of the laziness of the Hottentots, and of the great difficulty there had always  been in persuading them to work, either on the buildings or in the garden; and  in this complaint there was too much truth.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;A small channel, conducting from a  spring in the upper part of the mead to some huts and corn-land below, supplied  us with plenty of good water. The station, like every one in the vicinity, was  open and exposed; but it had a pleasant prospect of the whole of the village,  to which a narrow path led across the mead.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;The neighbourhood was first reconnoitered,  to ascertain where firewood was to be found; but this article had been every  where consumed by the inhabitants of the kraal, and was to be procured only at  a great distance.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;This being Sunday, I attended the  service in the church, or meeting-house. The building which they call so was  rudely built of rough unhewn timber and reeds, covered with a thatched roof,  and having a smooth, hard earthen floor, kept in order by being frequently  smeared with cow-dung, in the manner practised by the colonists. Within, the  sides were plastered with mud; and, being whitewashed with a kind of clay,  which is found near the river, they looked tolerably clean; but the rafters and  thatch constituted the only ceiling. The eaves were about six feet from the  ground. The upright posts, the beams and rafters, were either of Acacia or  Willow, and tied together with strips of Acacia-bark. The space within the  building was a long parallelogram, which, when quite filled, might perhaps  contain a congregation of three hundred persons, in the way in which them  Hottentots squat on the ground; for there were no seats, excepting about a  dozen, which some of the more civilized of the auditors had provided themselves  with. On one of the longer sides the door-way was placed, and opposite to it, a  pulpit raised a step above the floor.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;This is the ordinary routine of the  business of the mission as I observed it during the four months which, at  different times, I spent at Klaarwater. And, with respect to its effects in  forwarding the object of it, I cannot say that they appeared to me very  evident: certainly, I saw nothing that would sanction me in making such  favorable reports as have been laid before the public.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;The village itself is situated close  on the eastern side of a low rocky ridge, composed of an argillaceous slate or  stone, divisible into thin lamina like that of the Asbestos mountains; between  which, however, no asbestos has hitherto been observed. On one side is a long  grassy mead of irregular shape, and containing above a hundred acres. This,  being the lowest ground, receives the drainings and springs of the whole  valley, and is, in some places, of a boggy nature. It is covered with coarse  grass, and, by a little trouble and management, might be converted into gardens  for the Hottentots, in the same manner as at Genadendal, and seems excellently  suited for the purpose. The soil is a dark mould; and springs, rising in  different parts of it, yield a never-failing stream of water during the whole  year. I found this water clear and wholesome at all times: it is, however, of a  calcareous nature, as is evident by the substance deposited on the roots and  stems of the reeds and sedge along its course. All these springs, collected  into a small rill, take their course through the mountains southward, by an  outpost called Leeuwenkuil (Lion's-den), and passing by Grootedoorn  (Great-thorn), another outpost, join the Great River, after running a distance  of forty miles. The whole substratum of this part of the country, for many  leagues northward and eastward, is a hard limestone rock of primitive  formation; and on this, rest the laminated argillaceous mountains. This  limestone rock in no place rises into mountains, but often forms the surface of  a great extent of country. I never saw in it any marks of extraneous fossils.  The soil on the higher grounds surrounding the valley, is remarkably red, being  a mixture of sand and clay, which produces bushes and a variety of plants; but  is subject to great drought during the summer.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;The number of (Khoikhoi) houses  immediately round the church, is not greater than twenty-five; but at a  distance, within the same valley, nearly as many more are scattered about; and  there are three or four at Leeuwenkuil, a place between the mountains, and  about a mile and a half distant. Within fifty miles, in various directions, are  nearly a dozen other out-posts; but they are not always inhabited: of these,  the largest is the Kloof.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;The aggregate number of inhabitants  at Klaarwater and the out-stations, amounted in the year 1809, as I was  informed, to seven hundred and eighty-four souls; and it was supposed that at  this time it had not decreased: for, although some had left them and returned  into the Cape colony, others had been added from that quarter in an equal proportion.  The Koras and (San) living within the Klaarwater district, cannot be considered  as belonging to the establishment, since they show no desire to receive the  least instruction from the missionaries, nor do they attend their meetings, but  continue to remove from place to place, a wild independent people.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;The tribe of (Khoikhoi) now at  Klaarwater, had its origin from the two families of the Mixed Race, of the name  of Kok and Berends, who, about forty years ago, preferring their freedom on the  banks of the Great River to a residence within the Cape colony, where they had  acquired a few sheep in the service of the farmers, emigrated thither from the  Kamiesberg with all their cattle and friends. These were, from time to time,  joined by others of the same race, who found their life under the boors not so  agreeable as they wished. Thus, their increasing numbers rendered them an  object worth the attention of the missionaries; whose station amongst the  Bushmen at Zak River, happened to break up about the year 1800. These  Hottentots appearing to offer an easier and more promising soil for their  labors, the missionaries attached themselves to them, and followed them in all  their wanderings along the river, till they were at last persuaded to remain  stationary at Aakapp, and finally at Klaarwater;&nbsp; which, at the time they took possession of  it, was a (San) kraal.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;The existence of this little  community of (Khoikhoi), was well known to the colonists under the name of the  Bastaards, because the whole of them were at that time, of the Mixed Race. They  had always professed, among themselves, the Christian religion; and at one time  were the dupes of a religious impostor, named Stephanus.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;The dwellings of the missionaries  stand close together in a line with the meeting-house, forming, with two others  in a parallel line, a kind of street, in the middle of which stood, at this  time, a stuffed camelopard, which, being much weather-beaten and decayed, was  soon afterwards taken down. This object, reminding me that I was in the country  where these animals were to be beheld alive, added a pleasing and very  interesting feature to this little village.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;The only piece of masonry was the  foundations of a large building, intended to comprise under one roof a  meeting-house and the dwellings of the missionaries; but its only use is to  prove that a plan of rendering the mission respectable in its appearance was  once entertained. It was commenced, I believe, about seven years before my  visit to Klaarwater, and was carried on with spirit by the united labor of the  whole community, until the walls reached the height of five or six feet; and in  this state it has remained ever since, and still continues, without any  prospect of being completed. This neglect is attributed to the temper of the  (Khoikhoi), who, like children pleased with a new toy, which is soon thrown  aside, at first laboured readily at the work, and would not have deserted it if  three or four months could have brought it to a conclusion; but finding, after  the novelty of the job had worn off, that nothing was left but hard labor,  their little stock of exertion and patience became exhausted, and the thing was  given up as an undertaking of too great a magnitude. There was no want of  materials; since their mortar was obtained close at hand, being merely mud, and  the adjoining hill supplied the stone, which was formed by nature of shapes the  best adapted for masonry: while timber might easily be procured from the banks  of the Gariep, or even much nearer. The business of sawing planks has not yet  been introduced here; but two or three people work as blacksmiths, although in  a very bungling manner.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;The only means of rendering this  mission permanent, is to induce these people to acquire property in immoveable  buildings, and in gardens well stocked with fruit-trees. These they would be  unwilling to desert, on account of the labor and time that would be required to  procure the same advantages on another spot. To persuade them to erect such  buildings, had been, as Mr Anderson informed me, his constant endeavour; and it  was not without reason that he complained of the laziness of the people, and of  their unwillingness to regulate their conduct by his instructions and advice.  It is certainly not an easy task to change the customs and prejudices of any  people; but still, however, it may in many cases be done; and, whenever  improvements more conducive to their happiness can be substituted in the place  of their own rude notions, the attempt may conscientiously be made, and, to a  certain extent, persevered in&quot;.</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Burchell also described Captain Dam's  homestead as follows:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;We also visited Captain Dam, as he  is called, the (Khoikhoi) chief of Klaarwater, who holds a sort of authority  over one-half of this tribe (of Mixwed Khoikhoi); while Captain Berends is, in  like manner, the regulator and commander of the other half. His name was Adam  Kok: he appeared to be under the middle age, with a countenance indicative of a  quiet disposition. My visit to him required no explanations, as the  missionaries had already made him acquainted with every thing respecting me.  His hut, which was close behind the missionary's, was not better than those of  other Hottentots; but was made of mats, in the usual hemispherical form.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;The vignette at the head of Chapter  20 is a representation of Captain Dam's hut, and of his wagon of which mention  is made in the following chapter. Behind them are seen some of the trees of the  missionary's garden, enclosed by a hedge of dry bushes. The trunk of a tree is  fixed up near the hut, for the purpose of preparing (or, as they call it,  breyen) leathern reims, and for hanging game and various other things upon.  Such an apparatus is called by them, and by the colonists, who also make use of  it, a Brey-paal. On the ridge in the distance may be seen, just above the  Brey-paal, a part of the road leading to Ongeluk's Fontein&quot;.</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Upon a subsequent visit, in 1812, Burchell  commented upon the increase in size of the settlement at Klaarwater.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;At my former visit to this village,  the number of mat-huts was twenty, it was now twenty-five. This increase of  population was occasioned by the return home of those families who had been  residing with their cattle on the banks of the Gariep during the dry  season&quot;.</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>In 1812 William Burchell also noted fluctuations  in the Khoikhoi population of Klaarwater.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;On our road this afternoon, we met a  party of men, women, and children, with their huts and all their goods,  removing from Klaarwater to the Asbestos mountains. The whole family, with  mats, sticks, utensils, and skins, packed all together on the backs of the  oxen, and moving along with a steady pace, presented a curious group, which  might have been fancied to bear some resemblance to the journeyings of the  people of patriarchal days, notwithstanding the dignity, and splendid robes,  with which modern painters have thought proper to invest them. At least, their  bringing to recollection, a party of Gypsies in England, removing from one  county to another, is an idea less fanciful and speculative. We stopped a few  minutes to answer each other's questions as to the whence, the whither, the  when, and the wherefore of our journeys; nor did I forget to ask the men if  they would like a trip to Graafreynet.</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The next visitor of note to visit the  Mission was John Campbell in June 1813 when Klaarwater changed its name to  Griquatown.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;The whole people likewise resolved  that henceforth they should be called Griquas, instead of Bastard (Khoikhoi),  and the place called Griqua-town, instead of Klaar Water&quot;.</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Two months later, in August 1813, John  Campbell also commented on local craft skills.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;Trades can scarcely be said to exist  in Griqualand. There are some who may be termed bambus-makers, or makers of  vessels of wood for holding milk or water. Some can do a little at smith's-work,  in repairing waggons, and one man (Fortuyn at Hardcastle) can construct a  waggon. From the appearance of the new meeting-house they are building, which  stands unfinished, there must be tolerably good masons among them. The women  make mats of rushes. Upon the whole, I believe this mission has been a great  blessing to this part of Africa&quot;.</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>John Campbell returned to Griquatown in  March 1820 when he recorded the following:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;I walked with Mr Helm to call upon  some of the people in their own houses. Among others we visited a little  cluster of huts about a quarter of a mile from the town. They have many  dwellings, which are called round-houses, in the town; one such is at this  little village, it is built of stone about the height of five feet, and fifteen  feet diameter, with a conical roof, a door, and one window. The same Griqua who  inhabited the round-house was also building a square one of stone, about thirty  feet by twelve, with a door and three windows. The walls were well built and  nearly finished. When completed, he meant to use the round-house as a store.  Three Griqua women, dressed in the European fashion, were sewing some cotton  articles; three or four others came from the huts dressed in the same manner;  to all of whom I made presents of needles, thread, thimbles, etc&quot;.</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>In about 1836 Arbousset and Daumas  commented upon the condition of the Khoikhoi population of Griquatown:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;They now live at Griqua Town and  Campbell's Dorp. They have given up their miserable huts for houses more  healthy, and more commodious; and their sheepskin cloaks for European clothing.</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Griquatown was subsequently visited by  James Backhouse in September 1839 when he recorded the following:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;Griqua Town is situated on the edge  of an extensive, limestone plain, and at the foot of a range of low hills of  silicious schistus, producing yellow asbestos. Its original name was  Klaarwater, &quot;Clearwater&quot;, taken form its clear and copious spring,  which not only supplied the town, but watered the vale extending toward the Orange  River. At the time of our visit, a drought which had lasted about six years,  had reduced this spring to a standing pool; the water did not reach the surface  by a foot and a half, notwithstanding that a few smaller springs, which were  more superficial, within two or three miles, continued to flow. The gardens and  adjacent lands were desolate; a solitary peach-tree and a few fig-trees were  all that survived in the former; and few of the Griquas remained upon the  place. Many of the houses, that had been forsaken in consequence of the  drought, were in ruins. The occupied houses were those of the Chief, the  Missionaries, the school-teachers and a few others. But in the vicinity there  were some Basutu villages, inhabited by people who were rescued by the Chief,  Andries Waterboer, from the Bergenaars, who were a horde of banditti that  separated from the Griquas of this place.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;In the annexed etching of Griqua  Town, the houses of the missionaries and teachers, with the schools, the  chapel, and some other buildings, form the irregular line on the left, and that  of the chief, with two mat huts at the end, is at a distance, in front. Those  at the foot of the bushy, schistose hill in the foreground were in ruins.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;Many of the houses of Griqua Town  were of raw brick, plastered with clay and cow-dung. Lime entered largely into  the composition of the clay, and consequently, the brick would not stand when  burnt; in the raw state it endured the weather well&quot;.</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Twenty years later, in about 1859, John  MacKenzie was to paint a somewhat different picture.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;But some years before my first  visit, the once prosperous villages of Gruiqua Town and Campbell had been  ruined by the drying up of the fountains &ndash; the apparent strength of which had  been the chief reason for their selection as sites for villages. At Griqua Town  everything bore the evidence of former prosperity. But the gardens and fields  were now parched up and quite uncultivated, while many of the houses were  deserted and in ruins. The impression produced on our minds was one of sadness  and disappointment. But when we had visited some of the neighbouring  homesteads, and saw the manner in which the people were living, our feelings  were considerably changed. Both in Griqua Town district and Philippolis we  found some of the people in possession of houses, waggons, and clothing quite  equal to those of many Dutch farmers&quot;.</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>By the time Frederick Selous visited it in  November 1871 Griquatown had fallen upon distinctly hard times:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;On November 9th we trekked, and  reached Griqua Town the following day. This place, like Campbell's-dorp, must  have seen better days, but was now almost deserted&quot;.</em></p>

        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;We visited the  cottages (of the Khoikhoi), many of which were neat and clean, white within and  without; several were divided into two rooms, and had funnel-chimneys, to allow  the escape of the smoke of their little, wood fires. Fires are often made in  the middle of the floors of Hottentots' huts, and the smoke escapes by the  door, or any hole it can find in the thatch. The number of dwellings at Hankey  is considerable, and several more of neat construction are in progress. The  settlement is situated on a little bushy flat, on the Camtoos River, capable,  in common seasons, of irrigation and of cultivation to a considerable extent.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;The chapel is a neat, plain  building. In order to accommodate the Temperance Tea Meeting, the tables were  placed in a line down the centre, with three rows of seats facing them on each  side.

They intend immediately to begin erecting a  meeting-house for the worship of God. On finishing this, Bern, the Captain, and  some others, design to build better houses for themselves, to which we have  frequently urged them, as calculated to wean them more effectually from a  wandering life, to which they still feel a propensity; and, as an ox can carry  on its back any of the houses in which most of them now live, they are  encouraged, by this facility of removing, often to take long and needless  journies with their cattle&quot;.</em></p>

        <p>Campbell also recorded that:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;A meeting-house of stone stands  unfinished here, the same as at Griqua town: the best house at Griqua town is  also in the same state, and so is the best house here.

The sun was just rising beyond  the great Table Mountain and tinting the edge of the heavy masses of mist with  its golden light, while its increasing warmth was gradually breaking up and  dispersing them and momentarily revealing more and more of the landscape. Small  jets of smoke issuing from every crevice of the huts shewed that the inmates  were beginning to move, and presently out crept one from one hut, and two or  three from another, till at last the village was astir; and the people, as  varied and motley in their dress and countenance as the places they inhabited,  separated to their different employment, the chief of which is, invariably,  milking the cows, and driving out and tending the cattle&quot;.</em></p>
