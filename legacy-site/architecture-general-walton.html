	    EDITORIAL IN HONOUR OF
	    JAMES WALTON</h5>
	  <p align="left">Franco Frescura</p>
	  <p>In 1974, for reasons best known to itself, the University of the Witwatersrand awarded me a R25 book prize for  undergraduate research in History of Architecture. Having something of a  reputation to uphold, my first choice was a volume entitled &quot;The  Foreign Policy of Communist China&quot;. The remaining R7 was spent on a  copy of James Walton's &quot;<em>African   Village</em>&quot;. To  this day, Beijing's  political machinations remain an inscrutable mystery to me. Walton's volume, on  the other hand, has become one of my most treasured possessions.</p>
	  <p>As I soon discovered, &quot;<em>African Village</em>&quot;  was neither the first nor has it been the last opus to flow from James'  prolific pen. It is thanks to him that succeeding generations of architectural  students have been introduced to the rich textures and imaginative forms of our  folk architecture.</p>
	  <p>This is just as well for, as many of my colleagues in the teaching  profession will testify, an appreciation of the vernacular built environment is  somewhat of an acquired taste. Students often are all too easily seduced by the  glossy forms, machine aesthetics and megalomaniac grandeur of modern movement  buildings so predilected by the architectural press. The words of Laugier who,  in 1753, admonished us to &quot;look to the humble hut&quot;, are soon  lost beneath a plethora of superlatives and post-rationalised hype aimed at  promoting the concept of the Architect as a powerful, virile, patriarchal  Renaissance figure. Those who choose to sample the subtle cultural nuances of  an architecture which is the result of complex human interactions often have to  fight off the hammer blows of conspicuous consumerism in an industrial society  which has become divorced from its historical and cultural roots.</p>
	  <p>Yet the architecture of what Rapoport has called the &quot;<em>Grand  Design Tradition</em>&quot; only comprises an extremely small percentage of the  world's built environment. The remainder is normally the work of peasant  farmers, owner-builders and crafters who operate in a gray area where aesthetics  is governed by pragmatic functionalism, and is not the product of style or an  effete fashion statement. Often these environments are the result of social  process in which women play an important, if not a leading, role in its  production. Thus, in many ways, a denial of vernacular architecture is also a  refutation of the function of women in the creation of shelter, and goes some  way in reinforcing the stereotype of Architecture as the cultural construct of  patriarchal society.</p>
	  <p>Although James Walton's work is not necessarily grounded in more  recent philosophies which see material culture as a series of texts, sub-text  and silences to be read and interpreted, it does in many ways precede them. His  books and articles do not set out to celebrate specific academic theory, or to  act as a show-case for the author's intellect. They are a modest and often  understated recognition of the fact that men and women of all cultures,  religions and continents come together on a daily basis and collaborate in the  production of shelter. Their work is thus relatively humble, and to represent  it otherwise would be a denial of its origins.</p>
	  <p>There is, of course, no doubt that there exists in the vernacular  vast scope for glossy celebration. Titles such as &quot;<em>African Mural</em>&quot;,  &quot;Spectacular Vernacular&quot;, and &quot;The Unconventional  Builders&quot; abound in our literature, and uniformly suffer from an  unfortunate tendency to highlight the visually magnificent, the unique, and the  idiosyncratic. Therefore, by seeking to elevate the vernacular to the status of  the &quot;heroic&quot;, they too seek to perpetuate the modernist vision  of the built environment.</p>
	  <p>Fortunately this has not been the way of James Walton. His texts  are presented in a straight-forward, readable and unpretentious manner, and the  only elaboration he allows himself is the inclusion of the clear and incisive  pen-and-ink sketches which have become the hall-mark of his work. In the  process he has also understood the character of his readership. When it comes  to the written word architects are notoriously illiterate, and their books and  articles often require extensive graphic explanation. To his credit, James does  not pander up to such short-comings, but allows his work to be read,  interpreted and enjoyed at a number of levels.</p>
	  <p>In the final analysis, however, the work of James Walton is  defined by the fact that it was carried out at a time when a concern for our  material culture and the conservation of our architectural heritage did not  feature highly on our national agenda. It coincided with a period when the  rural society of our country was in the throes of being transformed by the  forces of racism, colonialism and competing nationalisms. These brought with  them a bitter harvest of rural poverty, land alienation, migrant labour and the  break-down of historical family structures. Many of the architectures,  technologies and artifacts which James Walton documented will never again see  the light of the African sun.</p>
	  <p>In this volume, therefore, we join in saluting a man whose example  has inspired a whole generation of architectural historians; whose energy has  ignited, fuelled and sustained a whole school of enquiry; and whose vision has  made it possible for future generations of South Africans to look back upon  their architecture with a sense pride and of achievement. Academics are a  notoriously fickle band, but I believe that when all is said and done, history  will look kindly upon the work of James Walton.</p>
	  <h5>POSTSCRIPT</h5>
	  <p>This Editorial was published in the South African Journal of Art  and Architectural History, Vol 4, Nos 1-4, 54-74 (1995), which I was invited to  edit. The journal was compiled as a festschrift in honour of James  Walton, and included essays by Victor Papanek, Tim Maggs, Barrie Biermann,  Graham J Hardie, Dennis Claude, Brian Kearney, Dennis Radford, Paul Oliver and  myself. Fourteen years later, I still receive requests from people hoping to  find a copy.</p>
