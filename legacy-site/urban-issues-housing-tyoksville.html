	    <strong>TYOKSVILLE, EASTERN CAPE - 
	    A Survey of the Housing Needs in a  Transitional Settlement Area</strong></h5>
	  <h5>ABSTRACT</h5>
	  <p>Low cost housing is one of the major social, political and  economic issues facing this country today and will remain an important item on  our national agenda for many years to come, regardless of the ruling  government's ideological base. In spite of this fact, however, many local  agencies persist in providing housing units with a minimum of reference to the  needs and desires of their client body. In most cases their decision-making is  guided by factors of affordability and where human elements are taken into  account these are usually based upon outdated historical precedent, anecdotal  reference and preconceived cultural assumptions. As a result housing has been  reduced to a series of financial formulas which have neatly excised potential  residents from the processes involved thereby placing participants - the  housing agencies and their recipients - into a capitalist consumer-producer  relationship. This means that both parties enter the housing process as  potential antagonists and not as partners and collaborators in the resolution  of this most thorny of problems.</p>
	  <p>This project, set in Tyoksville, Uitenhage, represents an attempt  to open up new channels of communication between the people concerned and those  companies involved in housing development. Residents were asked to identify  their preferences on a wide range of subject matter including siting, aesthetic  image, spatial usage and self-help projects as well as the more conventional  factors of demographic composition and economic activity. Most specifically it  was hoped to derive a series of broad guidelines which would inform the  developers as to their options and create a base for further interaction  between themselves and the community concerned.</p>
	  <h5>PREFACE</h5>
	  <p>In many ways 1976 may be considered to have been a watershed year  in the history of southern Africa. It marks a  time when our black community once again renewed their struggle for liberation  in a forceful and effective manner. More important however, it is also a period  when conservative whites began to take heed of black grievances more seriously  than they had ever done before.</p>
	  <p><img src="images/arch/housing4.jpg" width="300" height="453" class="imagewrap" /></p>
	  <p>One of the key issues to emerge from this era was that of housing.  It was realised that the blind implementation in the 1970s of a policy designed  in the 1950s to meet the needs of the 1930s had produced urban environments  which were often squalid, overcrowded and promoted antisocial behaviour. As a  result a number of organizations were established in order to address some of  the fundamental and most pressing needs in southern Africa's  black residential areas.</p>
	  <p>Seen in the context of the larger housing effort which has been  taking place in this country since 1976, this survey ranks as little more than  a small link in a larger chain of events. Sadly however much of housing is  still being carried out locally by both public authorities and private sector  developers without prior consultation with the communities concerned. In this  respect then this research is important for it marks the opening of a two-way  process of communication between the residents of kwaNobuhle and organizations  outside of the town who feel they have the resources, technical know-how and  social commitment to become involved in a process of raising their quality of  life.</p>
	  <p>My thanks are therefore extended to the residents of kwaNobuhle  Extension 4C, sometimes also referred to as Tyoksville, for the cooperation  shown us in the completion of this survey. Their personal warmth and open  manner belied the trauma suffered by this same community less than twelve  months previously when they underwent removal from their homes of long standing  at Xaba.</p>
	  <p>However, it should be borne in mind that this survey set out to  discover only the housing aspirations, wishes and opinions of the residents of  kwaNobuhle. As such it is no more than a regional case study and care should be  exercised not to award it wider significance than originally intended. Thus  whilst the findings of this report may strike a responsive chord among  researchers elsewhere in this country, the conclusions arrived at may not  necessarily hold true outside their original context.</p>
	  <h5>INTRODUCTION</h5>
	  <p>KwaNobuhle is a dormitory town situated some four kilometers south  of Uitenhage, near Port Elizabeth,  in the eastern Cape  region (figure 1). It has a predominantly black population of about 113,117  persons living on an estimated 17,332 residential sites (Setplan, 1986: figure  2). The average density for the area has been calculated at 6.9 persons per  stand.</p>
	  <p>The town, whose name in Xhosa literally means &quot;a place of  beauty&quot;, traces its origins back to 1967. It was established in order  to house those residents of the old Uitenhage suburbs of Langa, Xaba and New  Gubbs who, at that time, were being displaced from their homes by the  authorities under provisions of the Group Areas Act. Although these areas  included many older and more substantial brick dwellings, over the years these  had been extended by means of corrugated iron and timber lean-to shacks. Thus  many of these houses were relatively large and, owing to residential pressures  in the area, had a high tenancy rate. The resultant population densities  threatened to overload the existing infrastructure and, instead of extending  the residential framework, the Uitenhage   Municipality, under whose  jurisdiction these areas fell, chose the cheaper option of building a new  settlement outside the town. As a result kwaNobuhle Extension 1, comprising  some 2,500 residential sites, was established in 1967. Houses were built by the  Municipality on the NE 51/6 model (Calderwood, 1953), consisting of a  four-roomed brick structure roofed over with corrugated asbestos sheeting. No  ceilings or internal doors were provided and all ablution facilities were  located separate from the main house to the rear of the stand. Although roads  were already tarred, electricity was only made available to business stands and  a small number of neighbouring residences. Road lighting was also limited to a  few streets.</p>
	  <p>Although official reasons given at the time for the removal of  people from Uitenhage to kwaNobuhle were unclear and often contradictory, it  has since become obvious that this land was required by the town's planners for  other residential uses. Removals were made on a block-by-block basis and were  accompanied by the wholesale demolition of the residents' old homes. Some  efforts were made to also accommodate those families who did not own homes in  the old areas, but official lists of them were by no means complete and many  were left behind. The authorities also failed to take into account those  tenants who were unmarried and thus did not qualify for housing in the new  areas. A combination of these factors had the effect of increasing residential  densities in those dwellings left standing thereby causing a deterioration in  their inhabitants' quality of life.</p>
	  <p>The removal, at that time, of families from Langa, Xaba and New  Gubbs does not appear to have been done forcibly. However many people felt that  they had been given little choice in the matter and the move was not a popular  one among the people concerned. KwaNobuhle was considered to be windy, removed  from town's commercial centre and devoid of the social support groups and  amenities which were offered by the older and more established suburbs. House  rentals and service levies also stood at about R13.00 per month, a figure which  few families could apparently afford at that time. As a result many people are  known to have returned back to their old suburbs in Uitenhage, thus further  increasing housing pressures in those areas. In many cases residents rebuilt  their homes on their previous sites leading to the idiosyncratic sight of  lean-to shacks standing on the surviving brick plinths of formerly substantial  and well-to-do houses.</p>
	  <p>In spite of such resistance and the objections posed by  Uitenhage's black citizens, kwaNobuhle has continued to expand (figure 2). The  town virtually doubled its size in 1974 with the proclamation of Extension 2  and by 1980 it had reached 24% of its present size. Further township  developments took place in 1980 and in 1984 with the establishment of  Extensions 3, 4A and 4B (Setplan, 1986: figure 2). However the town was to gain  42% of its present population in a brief seven months, between May and November  1986, when the residents of the old Uitenhage suburb of Xaba, also known to  whites as Kabah, were resettled in kwaNobuhle. Although the authorities  concerned have insisted that residents made this move voluntarily, many of the  people involved have claimed that they were removed forcibly from their homes.</p>
	  <p>Such rapid expansion of the town's population necessitated the  proclamation, in quick order, of Extensions 4C, 5, 6, 7 and 8. Official sources  have estimated that between 35,258 and 47,423 people were involved in this  removal (Setplan, 1986: figure 2) although other sources have placed this  figure closer to 80,000 persons (Riordan, 1986). A further three suburbs,  involving a total of 3000 new stands, are being planned for development in 1988  with a view to housing the last remaining inhabitants of the Uitenhage suburb  of Langa.</p>
	  <p>Briefly  put, expansion has occurred as follows:</p>
	  <blockquote>

	    </blockquote>
	  <p>Although these suburbs have not been awarded official names to  date, a popular nomenclature has arisen in many of their cases. Since the  declaration of the 1985 State of Emergency,  Extension 1 and Extension 2 have become known as &quot;Angola&quot;  and &quot;Mocambique&quot; respectively. Their analogy to war zones in  the minds of the residents is inescapable. Extension 4, on the other hand,  displays distinct middle-class aspirations and parts of it have become known as  &quot;Comfihomes&quot; after one of the building firms which erected  houses there. Other areas of Extension 4 are currently also referred to as  &quot;Volksville&quot; owing to the high percentage of Volkswagen  employees who live there. Extensions 5, 6, 7 and 8 and parts of Extension 4 are  called &quot;Tyoksville&quot; or &quot;Shackville&quot; and owe  this name predominantly to the nature of their housing. In more recent times however,  Tyoksville has also become known as Khayelitsha, a Xhosa name meaning  &quot;New Home&quot;. The socio-economic nature of these suburbs also  tends to vary considerably. Extensions 1 and 2 were developed by the Uitenhage Municipality and consist almost entirely  of NE 51/6 dwellings planned and built as a low-income mass-housing project.  Extension 3 was developed by the Bantu Affairs Administration Board (BAAB) but  its housing reflects a mixture of the NE 51/6 and the more comfortable and  larger NE 51/9 which incorporated an inside bathroom in its structure. The  decreasing involvement of Governmental agencies in the construction of housing  becomes evident in those parts of Extension 4 developed before 1986, that is to  say Sections 4A and 4B, which have a mixture of government-built NE 51/9s and  more conventional contractor-built houses. The BAAB however was responsible for  the infrastructural development of Extension 4 as a whole. Extensions 4C, 5, 6,  7 and 8 are currently made up almost entirely of owner-built shacks constructed  in a variety of scrap materials although in some isolated cases,  contractor-built houses are beginning to replace the original lean-to  structures. Extension 4C, the subject of this paper, is currently the best  developed of these last-mentioned suburbs, being already endowed with a full  reticulated infrastructure whilst the others suffer from a rudimentary water  delivery and waste removal system and many of their roads are no better than  muddy quagmires.</p>
	  <p>A small number of single sex hostel rooms are also available in  kwaNobuhle but as this involves less than 300 persons, their influence on the  residential fabric of the town may be considered to be negligible.</p>
	  <p>The administration of the town has, over the years, been the  responsibility of a number of bodies. At its onset, in 1967, this fell with the  Uitenhage Municipality but in 1973 its functions  were taken over by the Bantu Affairs Administration Board, an agency of the  central government department of Bantu Administration. In 1979 this body was  incorporated into the larger Eastern Cape Administration Board, although its  relationship to central government remained essentially unchanged. Finally, in  1983, the kwaNobuhle   Town Council was  established and its local administration was reconstituted as a municipality.  This remains the state of affairs to the present day.</p>
	  <p>Although the residential sector of the town has expanded rapidly  over the past six or seven years, development in other areas has been slow to  follow. To date kwaNobuhle boasts of four small clinics, a day hospital, two  high schools, fourteen primary schools, three police stations, one library and  a number of churches. The recently completed Civic Centre also includes a Fire  Station. Despite this there is little economic development: the town still  lacks a recognisable civic heart, it has no centralised shopping area and  retail business facilities have been established on a scattered and suburban  basis. There are no factories. Electrification has also been slow in spreading  and although Extensions 1 to 4 all have street lighting, domestic power  reticulation has been available only to those stands fortunate enough to be  located in the immediate vicinity of business sites. However plans to extend  full reticulation to all sites in Extension 4 by 1988 are well advanced.</p>
	  <p>The issue of electrification has become particularly bitter in  those areas of kwaNobuhle such as Comfihomes and Khayelitsha where residents  have already erected substantial houses. Here, a lack of domestic electricity  is forcing families to use alternative and more expensive sources of power and  denying them the quality of life they feel they are entitled to and are already  paying for through their rates.</p>
	  <p>One of the potential problems which is already becoming evident in  kwaNobuhle relates to its vehicular accessibility. Although the town is well  situated, being located in close proximity to the motorway joining Uitenhage to  Port Elizabeth,  its sole link to the outside world is via two roadways, only one of which is  linked to the town's main employment and shopping centres. Whilst this may be a  valid strategy in terms of sealing the town off during times of civic unrest, a  typical feature of Verwoerdian and apartheid-inspired town design, this does  not necessarily make for good planning on a human scale. In the long term it  may be confidently predicted that this single factor will prevent the area from  developing a business centre independent of neighbouring Uitenhage, thus  reinforcing the &quot;company store&quot; relationship currently  existing between the two communities and promulgate KwaNobuhle's economic  dependence upon its neighbour well into the foreseeable future.</p>
	  <h5>SURVEY  OBJECTIVES</h5>
	  <p>As the result of preliminary work conducted in the shack suburbs  of kwaNobuhle between March and August 1987, Extension 4C, an area involving  1071 residential sites was selected for more intensive research. Although it  shared with the remainder of Tyoksville in its name, origins and character of  housing, this suburb stood apart from the remainder of the squatter area in  that its residents were resettled on stands which already had full  infrastructural support. This included reticulated water delivery, sewage  removal and a tarred road system. It was perceived that much of the  psychological trauma involved in the removal could be overcome relatively  quickly in this community through suitable affirmative action.</p>
	  <p>To this end it was believed that a body like the Urban Foundation,  who sponsored this survey, had the technical know-how, infrastructural resources  and social commitment to make a relevant contribution to this community in  their provision of new housing. Ultimately it was also hoped that such a  project will serve as a pilot for more extensive work in the town of kwaNobuhle  as a whole.</p>
	  <p>This survey  therefore set out to broaden understanding in the following areas of concern:</p>
	  <p>This  survey therefore set out to broaden understanding in the following areas of  concern: </p>
	  <ol type="a"><li>the  demographic profile of the community concerned, including family composition,  marital status and work descriptions.</li>
	    <li>the  origins of these families and the quality of life previously enjoyed by them.</li>
	    <li>individual  earnings and household incomes as well as family budgeting patterns for this  area.</li>
	    <li>the  processes and building technologies presently employed by local residents in  their housing efforts. This included dwelling sizes, current usage of space and  subjective response to present housing standards.</li>
	    <li>future housing expectations including size of dwelling, style of  construction and quality of building standards as well as the residents'  willingness to subsidise future housing efforts through sub-letting of premises  to outside tenants.</li>
	  </ol>
	  <p>Ultimately  this survey set out to achieve four major ends:</p>
	  <ol type="a">
        <li>provide  an evaluation of current housing standards in this area.</li>
	    <li>provide  a realistic assessment of the residents' housing needs and future expectations.</li>
	    <li>assess  the degree to which these could be met under their current economic conditions.</li>
	    <li>formulate  an architectural brief which would assist in the design and production of  future housing in the area.</li>
	    </ol>
	  <h5>METHODOLOGY</h5>
	  <p>The  survey was conducted in four major stages:</p>
	  <ol type="a">
        <li>Stage  One took place in October 1986 when a multi-disciplinary team of academics  including social workers, planners, medical doctors and an architect visited  the general Tyoksville area and conducted an informal survey of its social fabric  and physical infrastructure (Riordan, 1986). Data collected by individuals was  exchanged at a joint seminar held soon afterwards and a consensus of results  arrived at. These are reflected in the Exploratory Survey Results tabled below.</li>
	    <li>Stage  Two was run between March and September 1987 and took the form of a long-term  process of familiarization with Tyoksville during which time the area was  transversed on foot, residents were canvassed informally on a variety of topics  and some two thousand photographs taken.</li>
	    <li>Stage  Three involved the running of a small pilot study in an area immediately  adjacent to the survey area. As a result a number of small changes of emphasis  were made in the phrasing of the questionnaire, one question was omitted  entirely and two new ones included.</li>
	    <li>Stage  Four was comprised of the survey itself.</li>
	    </ol>
	  <p>The survey covered a total of 249 households or 23.2% of the  survey area. It was conducted during September and October 1987 by a small  group of volunteer workers mostly resident within kwaNobuhle. In this respect  some difficulty was initially experienced in finding suitably qualified  interviewers. Ultimately however this group was to include in their numbers  school teachers, a social worker and a former policeman.</p>
	  <p>Of the 249 interviews completed, 81.9% were with male and 18.1%  with female respondents. This bias is a direct reflection of the family profile  for this area where patrifocal families outnumber matrifocal ones by a ratio of  four to one.</p>
	  <p>All of the structures surveyed functioned as domestic dwellings  although there is no doubt that in at least nine cases, or 3.6% of the sample,  these also served as premises for backyard industries during the daytime.  Activities observed during the survey include motor vehicle repairs, freelance  liquor sales, broom and mat manufacture and a herbalist's dispensary. A number  of dwellings were also observed to operate as week-end church premises for a  variety of Christian sects.</p>
	  <h5>EXPLORATORY  SURVEY RESULTS</h5>
	  <p>An exploratory survey of the Tyoksville area of kwaNobuhle was  conducted in October 1986. This revealed the following:</p>
	  <ol type="a">
        <li>That  although residents had, in theory, been given the opportunity of resettling  according to family and neighbourhood preferences, in practice this had seldom  occurred. Thus little trace could be found of previous social support systems  and neighbourhood unit organizations. Most people had been resettled next door  to total strangers and often did not know where old friends or family relations  had been placed. This compounded the trauma inevitably caused by such removals.</li>
	    <li>Initial  settlement was made in canvas tents loaned by the South African Army for this  purpose. Thereafter residents were expected to erect their own dwellings. At  the time of the preliminary survey in March 1987 a number of Tyoksville  families were still living in such temporary quarters and by September a few  tents were still to be observed (figure 3).</li>
	    <li>Residents  of Extensions 6, 7 and 8 were living under rudimentary conditions with a  minimum of infrastructural support. Water was delivered by municipal tankers  and placed into communal reservoirs; human waste went into prefabricated toilet  units; and roads were laid out and graded in gravel. In reality however,  communal facilities were often vandalised by the residents themselves; water  supplies, when unpolluted, were insufficient for local use and tankers were  often late for their deliveries; most latrines inspected were hopelessly  clogged up; and roads were virtually impassable after a heavy rainfall. This  situation was worsened by the fact that, owing to the situation of civil unrest  prevailing in the country at that time, service teams were unwilling to enter  these areas.</li>
	    <li>Bus  services ran infrequently, were remote from the areas they were intended to  serve and were considered to be too expensive for a community which suffered  from a high unemployment rate (Riordan, 1986).</li>
	    <li>Health  services were non-existent.</li>
	    <li>Schools  had not yet been re-established.</li>
	    <li>Large  numbers of unemployed men and scholars were observed to be moving aimlessly  about the area. Although at no stage, then or since, have the organizers of  this survey come under personal threat, the prevailing mood was perceived to be  one of resentment and repressed anger.</li>
	    </ol>
	  <p>Within a week of this preliminary visit taking place, fighting is  recorded to have broken out in kwaNobuhle between supporters of AZAPO, UDF and  amaAfrica factions. Sporadic outbreaks of violence have been taking place in  this area ever since that time.</p>
	  <p>Although a number of commentators have subsequently attempted to  ascribe these conflicts to a variety of ideological differences manifesting  themselves within the black community, informal enquiries made within the  survey area have given rise to a variety of interpretations. Generally however  these events may be perceived to be the result of two major factors:</p>
	  <ol type="a">
	    <li>Tensions  existing between the more settled and conservative residents of Extensions 1, 2  and 3, where housing is of a more permanent and conventional nature, and those  of Tyoksville who, as recent settlers, live under impermanent and less affluent  conditions.</li>
	    <li>ii.  Tensions existing within the squatter area itself, reflecting that community's  recent trauma of removal and their precarious status of land tenure.</li>
	    </ol>
	  <h5>FINDINGS  OF THE SURVEY</h5>
	  <h5>A.  DEMOGRAPHIC PROFILE</h5>
	  <p>The 249 dwellings surveyed yielded a total of 1268 persons giving  an average of 5.09 persons per household. This housing stock provided a total  of 957 rooms thus giving an average density of 1.32 persons per room. Assuming  that at least one room per dwelling was used as a cooking and living area, thus  making it uninhabitable as a sleeping space, this left a total of 714 rooms  giving an effective residential density of 1.77 persons per room. After married  couples, who were assumed to be sleeping two to a room, were removed from the  equation, this still left 518 rooms to sleep 876 persons thus giving a density  of 1.69 persons per room. The highest individual population density discovered  was 5 persons per room in a single case where 15 persons were recorded to  inhabit a three-roomed dwelling.</p>
	  <p>Further analysis reveals that 155 dwellings or 62.2% of the sample  involved households of five persons or less. In this case a total of 587  persons was recorded to inhabit 554 rooms giving a density of 1.06 persons per  room. By comparison the remaining 94 dwellings or 37.8% of the sample involved  households of six persons or more giving a total of 689 persons residing in 403  rooms or a density of 1.71 persons per room. This indicates that although the  size of the average household for the survey is 5.09 persons, just over 60% of  the sample involved households with an average size of 3.78 persons living in  dwellings with at least one room per resident. On the other hand, just below  40% of the sample involved households of 7.24 persons with a population density  approaching two persons per room.</p>
	  <p>The average family unit in KwaNobuhle is likely to be nuclear and  comprise a father, 41 years, a mother, 36 years, and three minor children aged  15, 13 and 11 years respectively. However, at least one in every five families  was likely to include a grandparent in its makeup, whilst another one in every  six would have rented space out to a lodger.</p>
	  <p>The male/female ratio of the sample group for all age groups  showed a slight bias towards women. However this imbalance became more  pronounced in the 0-15 age group where girls outnumbered boys by 11:9.</p>
	  <p>The overall population sample shared a distinct bias towards youth  with 51.3% of people being 20 years or less whilst a massive 62.4% was below 25  years of age. By comparison only 4.2% of the group stood above the 65-year mark  (figure 4).</p>
	  <p>The area's potential work force, defined as any person who was  neither a scholar, a student or a pensioner, comprised only 42.7% of the  sample. Of this total 21% were unemployed, 23% were housewives and 25% were  unskilled labourers. This means that 68.5% of the potential work force was  either fully unemployed, technically unemployed or highly vulnerable to  unemployment. Only 19.2% of the survey was possessed of a technical skill and  only 0.4% was engaged in the professions. An analysis of these figures reveals  three significant factors:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>the  number of professional people such as doctors, nurses and teachers stands at a  low level of 0.4% of the sample. This may be attributed to the fact that  middle- range salary earners have resettled in higher income areas such as  KwaMagxaki and KwaDwesi closer to Port    Elizabeth. There is therefore a real danger that a  potential middle-income group may no longer be developing within the local  broad urban context but has already reached the status of a privileged elite  outside of it.</li>
	    <li>68.5%  of the potential work force, or five persons in every eight, are either fully  unemployed, being currently out of work, technically unemployed, being employed  as housewives and hence not engaged in direct wage earning, or highly  vulnerable to unemployment, being in current employ as unskilled labourers,  street sweepers, cleaners and so forth.</li>
	    <li>19.2%  of the people surveyed were found to be skilled crafters, artisans and machine  operators, all of whom, under favourable economic conditions, are potential  high wage earners.</li>
	    </ul>
	  <p>These figures may also be interpreted to mean that a community of  some 1268 persons is reliant upon an effective work force of 315 wage earners,  or 24.8% of the group, for their continued economic survival.</p>
	  <h5>B.  ORIGINS</h5>
	  <p>The majority, or 89% of the survey sample originated from the  Uitenhage suburbs of Xaba and Langa. The average length of previous residence  was 13 years per family although a sizeable number, or 41.1% of the sample, had  lived in their respective residences for an average of 32 years. The majority,  or 93.6%, had previously lived in lean-to dwellings of varying quality.</p>
	  <p>However one should beware of reading this data in a pejorative  sense. When questioned on the subject, former residents of Xaba remembered  their old homes with affection. They claimed them to have been relatively well  sheltered from the wind and complained that resettlement had taken place in  such a way as to disrupt their previous social structures and scatter their  support groups. They now lived next door to strangers and had not as yet  discovered the new homes of old friends and family relations. Rightly or  wrongly, they perceived themselves to have enjoyed a higher quality of life in  their previous homes than they did presently.</p>
	  <p>An overwhelming majority of respondents, 90.4%, claimed to have  been forcibly removed from their previous homes and resettled in kwaNobuhle.  The remaining 9.6% gave reasons of convenience and security of tenure. This  data should be read in context with the fact that 89.4% of this sample had  originated from the older black suburbs of Uitenhage. The inferences of this  data are clear: the residents of Xaba were &quot;persuaded&quot; by the  local authorities to vacate the homes they had occupied in some cases for over  three generations, and &quot;remove&quot; themselves to a site some six  kilometres away from their places of employment, areas of shopping and points  of transport. Althought this dislocation took place between July and December  1986 the issue still appears to be a major source of discontent among residents  some eighteen months later.</p>
	  <h5>C.  FINANCIAL PROFILE</h5>
	  <p>It was found that the survey sample of 427 persons generated a  total of R100,433 per month in wages and other earnings. This gave an average  of R236 per person per month. However the population profile also included 66  pensioners each of whom had a monthly income of R97. When these figures were  deducted from the total it was found that a corrected survey sample of 361 wage  earners generated a total of R94,031 per month giving an average earning of  R260 per worker per month. Assuming that most businesses are open for an  average of 21 working days per month, or 168 hours, this represents a wage of  R1.55 per hour or R12.40 per day. It was also noted that 72.4% of all income  generators in the survey earned R300 or less per month (figure 5).</p>
	  <p>It was found that the 249 households in the survey sample  generated a total of R105,871 per month in assorted earnings. These included  the weekly wages of 250 blue collar workers, the monthly salaries of 35 white  collar workers, the bi-monthly pension and disability grants of 72 retired  workers and the incomes of 30 self-employed entrepreneurs engaged in a variety  of pursuits from hawking to running an informal taxi service. This means that  the average household in the study area earned a total of R425 per month.  According to the latest figures available in November 1987 from the Institute of Planning Research at UPE, the Household  Subsistence Level (HSL) for a family of five living in the Uitenhage region is  R376 per month (Institute for Planning Research, 1987). This figure however is  regarded as a minimum and the same body has estimated a more realistic Household  Effective Level (HEL) to stand between R489 and R564 per month (figure 6).</p>
	  <p>The implication of this data is that a total of 138 households, or  55.4% of the sample, had an income equal to or less than a minimum HSL and  74.2% had an income equal to or less than a realistic HEL. It was also noted  that 25.3% of families in the survey earned R200 per month or less.</p>
	  <p>The average family had an expenditure of R347 per month. Alcohol  and tobacco accounted for 10.3% of this total whilst education took up only 7.5%  of this sum. Savings seem to account for 21.5% of the family budget. The  discrepancy between the household income and expenditure totals may be  attributed to a number of factors:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Many  respondents failed to answer this question either in total or in parts. This  data therefore is not a true reflection of the budget of an average household  in the survey area.</li>
	    <li>Incorrect  estimation of expenses during the course of interviews. It was felt that in  many cases respondents gave global figures without necessarily checking their  data.</li>
	    <li>A  variety of repayments and contributions were not taken into account during the  formulation of this question. These included Hire Purchase agreements,  lay-byes, money repayments and co-operative contributions.</li>
	    <li>Other  minor expenditures such as Burial Society contributions, insurance premiums,  and leisure expenses were similarly omitted from this survey.</li>
	    <li>It  is probable that there was a deliberate underestimation of alcohol and tobacco  consumption and an overstatement of monthly savings.</li>
	    </ul>
	  <p>It should be noted that although the results of this question are  being included in this report for the sake of completion, this data is not  borne out by the experience of field workers in kwaNobuhle itself. The figures  set out above for alcohol and tobacco consumption, for instance, are believed  to stand at approximately double the stated amount whilst those for savings are  almost unbelievably high.</p>
	  <p>Householders were also asked to estimate the sum of money which  they personally believed they could afford to repay on a house every month. The  question itself was not aimed at establishing the exact amount involved but at  the residents' subjective perception of how much they could afford to pay, or  were willing to contribute. The majority of respondents, 69.1%, set this figure  at R50 per month or less, whilst 90.2% gave an amount of R100 or less. Only  9.8% thought they could contribute a sum of R200 and above.</p>
	  <h5>D.  PRESENT HOUSING STANDARDS</h5>
	  <p>The survey found that 204 dwellings or 81.9% of the sample were  built either by the householders themselves or as part of a cooperative family  process. Of these a small minority, or 4% of the sample, had allowed local  municipal authorities to build an initial one or two-roomed core house for them  and had then extended it themselves. The remaining 45 families, or 18.1% of the  sample, had gone to other outside sources including the local municipality,  Uitenhage Sawmills or private building contractors. Thus sources outside the  community had been involved in the production of only 22.1% or just over  one-fifth of the dwellings in the survey.</p>
	  <p>As is implied by its name the dwellings of Tyoksville are built in  a variety of materials, usually the cast-offs of the consumer society about  them. The predominant method of construction in 98.8% of the survey is a timber  frame clad in either timber, iron or zinc sheeting, or a mixture thereof,  although in some singular instances other materials such as plywood (3.2%) or  bricks (2%) were also used. Industrial window frames were recorded in only  26.7% of dwellings and most window and door openings were created in scrap  timber by the residents themselves. Cement was recorded as having been used in  only 2.8% of all dwellings (figure 7).</p>
	  <p>These materials were obtained their materials from a variety of  sources. The major part, or 67.4%, are known to have been bought or received  secondhand. Most prominent among the latter were firms such as Volkswagen SA,  Veldspun and Gubb &amp; Inggs who made available their discarded crates to  their employees at no charge and between them accounted for materials used in  27.4% of recorded cases. Other prominent sources of recycled materials were a  variety of local scrap-yards and backyard dealers. It was interesting to note  that at least 4.2% originated from farm areas, presumably involving the owner  in some transport costs, whilst only a small amount, or 4.7% originated from  the resident's previous dwelling.</p>
	  <p>New materials were used in the construction of 32.6% of dwellings  in the area. In the majority of cases, or 62.1%, these originated from the  Uitenhage Saw Mills whilst the core houses erected by the local municipality  accounted for 30.5% of the total.</p>
	  <p>The cost of dwellings in this area varied greatly between nil, in  one instance, through to R17,000. The average cost for the 238 units covered in  the survey was R866 although this figure was distorted by the presence of eight  conventionally built units whose cost varied between R7,000 and R17,000 each.  When the latter were removed from the total the average cost per unit was  reduced dramatically to R609. It is significant to note that 10.1% of units  surveyed cost less than R100 each, that 59.5% cost less than R500 each and that  91.5% cost less than R2000 each.</p>
	  <p>The conclusion which may be drawn from this data is that the  majority of people living in this area exercise a great deal of discretion and  financial care in their provision of temporary shelter. In most cases a figure  of R600 represents a financial threshold which most residents are unwilling to  exceed in this type of housing. This may be an important psychological  consideration when considering the potential for upgrading existing shack  structures.</p>
	  <p>The clear shortage of dwellings in the R1000 to R6000 bracket,  which accounts for only 13.5% of the survey, seems to indicate that the lower  figure represents a ceiling of financial commitment to this form of housing.  However, when this information is read in conjunction with the financial data  arrived at elsewhere in this survey, it becomes obvious that, despite their  preference for housing built in a solid and conventional manner, the people  concerned cannot afford to erect structures of a higher standard through  existing commercial means.</p>
	  <p>Figures also show that the 249 residential units recorded in the  sample provided a total stock of 954 rooms or 3.8 rooms per dwelling. A  detailed breakdown of the data reveals that four-roomed houses accounted for  44.9% of the sample whilst 82.7% of units are either three, four or  five-roomed.</p>
	  <p>Respondents were also questioned as to the spatial values they  awarded to their indoor living areas. For want of detailed plans of each  dwelling, a task which would have been impossible under the circumstances,  generic nouns, such as kitchen, lounge and dining room were used to describe  the various rooms. It was recognised from the outset that these names were  originally derived in the context of Western European society and would find  limited application in an African community. For this reason field workers were  briefed on this point and definitions discussed at length. Thus although the  data which follows uses conventional room nouns for the purposes of this  report, during interviews field researchers described rooms by their functions.  The kitchen, for example, would have been referred to as &quot;a place for  cooking&quot; and so on.</p>
	  <p>The returns indicated that a degree of overlap exists between the  kitchen as cooking space, the lounge as an entertainment space and the dining  room as an eating space. Thus, although most households were found to have a clearly  defined cooking area, a minority of families also used the lounge, the dining  room and, in some instances, the master bedroom, for this same purpose. Similar  overlaps were perceived to exist in eating, sleeping and entertainment habits.</p>
	  <ol type="a">
	    <li>Cooking  was predominantly found to take place in one specialised space, the kitchen,  although a small minority of families also used the lounge and dining room for  this function. A small group of families, chiefly those inhabiting  single-roomed core dwellings, also used the bedroom to this end. </li>
	    <li>Eating  was almost equally divided between the kitchen and lounge area. The dining room  played a relatively minor role in this activity but a significant amount also  took place in the various bedrooms.</li>
	    <li>Sleeping,  predictably, centred upon the various bedrooms although, in a small minority of  cases, the lounge, dining room and even the kitchen served as additional  sleeping space.</li>
	    <li>Entertainment  of visitors took place in a number of indoor spaces, predominantly the lounge  (38.6%) and dining room (26.6%) which proved to be interchangeable in this  regard. A not inconsiderable amount of entertainment also took place in the  kitchen (22.2%). Bedrooms were little used for this function leading to the  conclusion that they were regarded primarily as areas of privacy not easily  accessible to non-family members. This was arrived at in conjunction with  another section of the survey where it was found that nearly 40% of persons  interviewed were forced to share their sleeping space with another member of  the family.</li>
	    </ol>
	  <p>On an average it was found that residents viewed a single-roomed  structure primarily as a bedroom space. The conclusion therefore was that, in  such cases and through necessity, cooking would be performed entirely out of  doors. In two-roomed units the bedroom remained the single most important room  in the house, followed by an entertainment/eating area with cooking being done  internally in only in 36% of cases.</p>
	  <p>However once the dwelling grew to include a third room, the  bedroom maintained its place as the most important room of the house but the  cooking function was brought indoors almost entirely and nearly supplanted the  combined eating and entertainment area as the second most important space in  the home. By the time the dwelling became a four-roomed unit, the kitchen was  firmly ensconced, alongside separate bedroom spaces for parents and children,  as the most important room in the dwelling. Thereafter, as the structure  increased in size to five and six rooms, greater emphasis began to be made upon  additional bedroom space for children and increasing distinction was made  between the functions of a lounge and a dining room as specialised spaces in  their own right.</p>
	  <p>Although some seven- and eight-roomed dwellings were also  surveyed, their sample was too small for relevant conclusions to be arrived at.</p>
	  <p>Generally speaking residents were unhappy with the technical  performance of their homes, but a significant proportion of them, nearly 40%,  were more positive in their approach. However, residents were unanimous in  condemning their shacks as being cold, unhealthy, flea-infested and unable to  keep out the dust and rain. Only a small minority specifically objected to  their aesthetic appearance.</p>
	  <h5>E. FUTURE  HOUSING EXPECTATIONS</h5>
	  <p>Residents interviewed were unanimous in their preference for a  solid and conventional brick-built house. Given the hypothetical choice between  a timber-framed, timber clad dwelling, one that was timber-framed but clad in  galvanized corrugated iron sheeting, a zenzele or modified  wattle-and-daub structure and a conventional brick house, 99.6% opted for the  more conventional brick technology whilst other building methods received  virtually no support.</p>
	  <p>Despite the fact that 81.9% of persons interviewed had originally  taken an active part in the erection of their own dwellings, the majority of  these same people now expressed an unwillingness to take a part in the  processes of building new homes for themselves at some future date. However  such reluctance should not be interpreted as apathy on the part of the  community concerned but rather as an indication of their preference for  strongly built conventional housing and their unfamiliarity with the technology  involved in its construction.</p>
	  <p>However, even though respondents expressed in almost every case an  overwhelming reluctance to become involved in the production processes of  almost all types of new housing for themselves, a moderate number were prepared  to provide themselves with a core house (20.5%) whilst a smaller number were willing  to build their own house provided the materials were provided (13.7%).</p>
	  <p>87.9/% of the sample considered an ideal house size to consist of  four to six rooms. In the case of a four-roomed dwelling these would consist of  a kitchen, a bedroom for the parents, another for the children and a  multi-purpose entertainment area. Five-roomed dwellings might include either an  internal bathroom or an additional children&rsquo;s bedroom whilst a six-roomed unit  would include both. The priority given to either garaging or tenants' rooms was  so small as to be negligible. The preference for internal bathrooms as against  external facilities was overwhelming but opinions on whether such a room should  include a WC or keep it in a separate cubicle were evenly divided.</p>
	  <p>Householders were also asked how many rooms would be included in  such a hypothetical home. Responses varied between three and eight rooms with a  six-roomed structure being considered as ideal by a majority of people. However  87.9% of the sample considered an ideal house size to vary between four and six  rooms. In view of the fact that the average family in the survey sample  consisted of five persons, this would give an ideal population density between  0.8 and 1.2 persons per room.</p>
	  <p>Respondents were also asked to establish the order of preference  which they, as owners of a hypothetical two-roomed core unit, would be likely  to establish in a long-term programme of expansion to their dwellings. They  were requested to begin with two rooms of their choice and thereafter to  increase the size of their dwelling one room at a time to a maximum of six  rooms.</p>
	  <p>It was found that the first priority of 78.5% of respondents was  the provision of a main bedroom. This was followed by a lounge/dining area, in  60.1% of cases, and a kitchen, in 45.5% of cases. In view of the  interchangeability found to exist between kitchen and family entertainment  areas during earlier data analysis, it becomes possible to make a number of  assumptions:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>that  the provision of an area of privacy is the first priority of a family</li>
	    <li>that  a degree of cooking may be done in an entertainment area or alternatively</li>
	    <li>that  the cooking area is a focal point of family interaction and</li>
	    <li>that  under certain conditions, cooking may be permitted to take place out of doors.</li>
	    </ul>
	  <p>This leads to the conclusion that a two-roomed core unit would  consist of one bedroom and one multi-purpose eating/cooking area with the  potential of converting this to an additional bedroom space at night.</p>
	  <p>Only 3.0% of respondents would have included a bathroom/toilet as  part of their two-roomed core house. This figure remains steady between 2.9 and  6.3% for three and four-roomed units but jumps to 14.7% for a five-roomed  house. This indicates that most persons interviewed as part of this survey  sample rated a bathroom/toilet as being of relatively low priority for any  dwelling smaller than five rooms but would have included one into their home  should it have been either five or six rooms in size.</p>
	  <p>When asked what room they would add next onto this hypothetical  two roomed dwelling, respondents' opinions were divided in three main  directions. A small number (14.4%) wished to add on an extra bedroom for their  children whilst two almost equal groups chose a kitchen (25.1) and a  lounge/dining space (28.4%) respectively.</p>
	  <p>Subsequent questioning for a fourth room showed that although  respondents were still concerned with the three main areas of main bedroom,  kitchen and living/dining space, the need for an extra bedroom for the children  became of overriding importance.</p>
	  <p>The choice of a fifth room posed few problems to respondents. The  majority opted for a bathroom and toilet although a smaller number also wished  to increase their childrens' accommodation. Significantly the idea of a bedroom  for a tenant and a garage also appeared for the first time.</p>
	  <p>The final choice of a sixth and last room to be added to the  hypothetical core house left little doubt as to the respondent's wishes. The  majority decided in favour of a bathroom although some householders expressed a  need for additional children&rsquo;s bedrooms. The garage also began to feature more  strongly at this stage. The idea of a bedroom to be rented out to tenants met  with little approval.</p>
	  <p>It is probable therefore that a six-roomed dwelling unit in this  area would include a lounge, possibly incorporating the dining room as well, a  kitchen, a bathroom/toilet and two bedrooms. A sixth room would function either  as a third bedroom or as a separate dining room.</p>
	  <p>Finally respondents were shown a chart with the perspective drawings  of a variety of dwellings ranging from traditional rural structures to modern  suburban cottages (figure 8). The following were the choices made:</p>
	  <blockquote>
	    <p>Lean-to farm cottage&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.7%<br />
	      51/6 Soweto  house&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 25.0%<br />
	      51/11 semi-detached Soweto  house&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.0%<br />
	      Single storey suburban cottage&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 55.4%<br />
	      Traditional Xhosa cottage&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.8%<br />
	      Lean-to farm cottage&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.9%<br />
	      Squatter shack&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.1%<br />
	      Double storey suburban cottage&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.1%</p>
	    </blockquote>
	  <p>Although results showed a marked preference for a suburban style  of construction and, in the process, firmly rejected farm structures, a  sizeable proportion, or 30% of the sample, showed a preference for an aesthetic  long associated in this country with governmental mass housing schemes. It was  also noted that respondents' tastes steered away from semi-detached dwellings  and double-storeyed structures. The majority of residents (94%) also preferred  their homes to be located either to the front or the centre of their stands.</p>
	  <p>Most respondents, 84.3% of them, were found to be overwhelmingly  against the concept of taking in tenants, even if the practice subsidised  repayments on their home by a substantial amount. Many householders commented  that they had been tenants in someone else's home all their lives and knew at  first hand of the inconvenience involved, whilst another group did not wish to  be bothered with it and stated that they valued their privacy. Understandably  therefore 83.2% of the householders surveyed were also not prepared to build  special rooms for the purpose of sub-letting to tenants whilst the remaining  16.8% stated that such rooms, if necessary, should be located apart from the  main dwelling.</p>
	  <p>This response is understandable in view of the living conditions  known to have existed in the survey group's former home at Xaba where tenancy  was widespread and social conditions prevailing in that suburb were attributed  in great part to its overcrowding. However, demographic data obtained during  the course of this survey reveals that approximately one in every five families  surveyed included at least one tenant in their household make-up.</p>
	  <h5>CONCLUSIONS (Frescura, 1987)</h5>
	  <p>It is evident from the above data that, for the purposes of future  housing developments, the residents of kwaNobuhle Extension 4C cannot be  assumed to be a homogenous body. Although the families interviewed were often  consistent in many of their preferences and preconceptions, they were separated  by two major factors vital in the make-up and planning of any large mass  housing project:</p>
	  <ol type="a">
	    <li>The  size and composition of households.</li>
	    <li>The  affordability of their housing.</li>
	    </ol>
	  <p>Both varied to such a degree that any plans to upgrade the area's  housing stock will have to employ a wide range of options. These will have to  take cognisance of the following data:</p>
	  <ol type="a">
	    <li>Approximately  39% of families in the survey area consisted of four persons or less. This  indicates that either a degree of family planning is taking place or that a  sizeable proportion of families are in their early stages of growth. Whatever  the case, this figure seems to indicate a potential market for three roomed  core houses.</li>
	    <li>The  low number of either tenants or family members recorded in the survey sample,  present in less than 37% of interviews, seems to indicate that extended  families are a factor in one household out of every three. In this respect it  was also noted that a discrepancy existed between the population figures  derived during the course of this survey and those put forward by official  sources. Similar studies conducted elsewhere in this country have consistently  shown official figures to be lower than those obtained through independent  research. In this survey however, the opposite was found to be true, most  particularly in the case of household sizes where the official figure for the  town of kwaNobuhle as a whole stands at an average of 6.9 persons whereas that  for Extension 4C was derived at 5.09 persons. An explanation for this may be  found in the high level of resistance discovered to exist among inhabitants of  Extension 4C to the concept of subsidising repayments on a house through tenancy.  It is possible that the residents of the older suburbs of kwaNobuhle, upon  whom&nbsp; current official figures are based,  have reached a level of home ownership where the subletting of rooms to tenants  has become a matter of economic survival. On the other hand, the inhabitants of  Tyoksville, whose present financial commitment to their housing is limited to a  R21.21 site and service charge, have not yet reached a stage where the  financing of their homes has achieved onerous proportions. This state of  affairs may well change at some future date as this community becomes more  settled and begins to erect more substantial dwellings for itself.</li>
	    <li>26%  of wage earners were engaged in jobs which afforded a measure of financial  security and work tenure. The families of this group could thus be considered  to be likely candidates for housing in the R15,000 to R20,000 bracket. However  less than 5% of households declared incomes which would allow them similar  housing. It is probable that the number of families qualifying for housing in  this price range lies between these two figures but is unlikely to be higher  than 10% of the survey sample.&nbsp; It is  probable that the housing needs of the remaining 90% may be met by a housing  package in the R6,000 to R10,000 range.</li>
	    <li>27.7%  of the survey sample expressed a willingness to take part in a self-help  housing process. The exact nature of the sweat equity was not specified but was  most likely to comprise participation in the construction of a core dwelling.  In view of the relatively low number of persons interviewed who were prepared  to take part in such a project, it is recommended that attitudes towards the  concepts of self-help construction and the upgrading of existing dwellings be  examined in greater depth with leaders of the communities concerned. Current  unwillingness to participate in self-help projects has been attributed by  residents to their unfamiliarity with a more conventional technology but this  may be overcome by a housing programme which includes in its make-up local  employment opportunities and on-site training schemes for residents of the  area.</li>
	    <li>An  approximate 50% of families surveyed tended to require dwellings of four to  five rooms. They were also largely the same group which could least afford such  housing.</li>
	    <li>An  opportunity also exists for the extension of informal sector infrastructures.  This survey established that local involvement in such economic activities  currently stands at 9% of the potential workforce. However a further 44% were  either unemployed or active as housewives thus giving this aspect of local life  great potential for expansion and growth.</li>
