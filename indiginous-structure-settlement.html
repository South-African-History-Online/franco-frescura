        <h5 align="left">STRUCTURE, SETTLEMENT AND SOCIETY - 
          A Southern African Case Study</h5>
        <p align="left">Franco Frescura</p>
        <h5>ABSTRACT</h5>
        <p>This paper is written from a post-structuralist, or Derridian,  standpoint (Sturrock 1979) which focuses upon the indigenous rural built  environment of southern Africa and interprets  it as a series of &quot;texts&quot;. These are constituted by the  background of the observer, by previous research on the subject, by intrusions  on the observer's consciousness, by such factors as oral history, and by the  &quot;text&quot; as written by its &quot;context&quot;. The  latter makes specific reference to the concept of intertextuality which will  cause the same object or dwelling placed in different contexts to give  different textual readings.</p>
        <p>Contingent to this argument is the acceptance of architecture as a  built environment constituted by a series of material and spatial elements,  each of whom is endowed with a particular contextual symbology, and whose  relationships are governed by a larger set of rules of grammar. As such then  architecture may be considered to be a cognitive language (Hall 1973), and its  elements, textures, details and spaces may be &quot;read&quot; and  interpreted as a series of texts, each having meaning in their own contexts  (Alexander 1977).</p>
        <p>In these terms rural architecture or, in this particular instance,  rural settlement, is viewed as a text whose reading yields much information in  the way of the economic activities, social mores, material environment and  technological culture of its creators. It is analysed not only as a given, but  it is also deconstructed in order to take into account underlying gaps and  silences. This does not constitute, as it were, a reading of what is between  the lines, but rather of what has been left unstated, often unconsciously.</p>
        <p>In the text which follows, the historical settlement patterns of  indigenous southern Africans have been divided into two major classifications.  This has been the result of a number of disparate factors covering a wide range  of concerns, including inheritance patterns, gender relations and religious  beliefs. Although both groups may be seen to share in a number of common  features, their contextual reading reveals these to be manifestations of more  fundamental structural differences between the two societies. Ultimately, it is  believed, that these are representative of wider differences in their  respective cosmological value structures.</p>
        <h5>INTRODUCTION</h5>
        <p>The western concept of a &quot;traditional&quot;  architecture for southern Africa or, indeed,  for Africa as a whole, has been beset  historically by a preoccupation with the aesthetics of the individual dwelling.  Authors such as Walton (1956) and Denyer (1978), as well as Frescura (1981)  have all published studies which focus upon the technologies and forms of the  dwelling unit but generally fail to emphasise their role in the larger  settlement structure. In some instances this work has been misinterpreted by  other agencies seeking justification for the creation of &quot;ethnic&quot;  stereotypes, thus reinforcing the western idea of house-form as the primary  manifestation of architecture as a cultural activity.</p>
        <p>Sadly this preoccupation with form is misplaced. The individual  dwelling seldom stands alone and is usually but one of a number of interlinked  residential spaces, both indoor and outdoor. These are not set randomly in the  rural countryside, but are organised according to a number of socially  predetermined norms. A study of the southern African rural homestead therefore  will reveal that its settlement patterns are subject to considerations of  social structure, inheritance hierarchy, burial rituals, religious beliefs and  economic practices. Thus any questions of architecture as a material  manifestation of culture and identity has to be resolved in the wider context  of the region's settlement customs and not according to ephemeral and transient  values of aesthetics.</p>
        <h5>SOME  BRIEF DEFINITIONS</h5>
        <p>The human perception of such concepts as house, homestead, and  village tends to vary as one moves from culture to culture, from people to  people and from place to place. Whilst such terms may outwardly appear to find  application in a number of disparate backgrounds, generalisations of this  nature usually fail to stand up to closer scrutiny as further considerations of  kinship structures, spatial organization and social hierarchies are brought  into the argument.</p>
        <p>It is seldom, for example, that the individual dwelling unit may  be termed a &quot;house&quot; in the Western sense of the word. It may  comprise the total house in some singular instances where it serves to shelter  a hermit or a bachelor, both rare in rural society, but generally it is but one  unit within a larger domestic complex.</p>
        <p>The term &quot;settlement&quot; is also ambiguous, and  capable of finding a number of different interpretations. In this case it is  used as a generic word to describe human habitat in its widest possible  context, embracing in its scope the full scale of population numbers, ranging  in size from the individual family through to the larger village and town.</p>
        <p>Within such a broad spectrum therefore the individual dwelling unit  may he defined as a single structure, usually one roomed, whose form covers the  full range of building types available to the indigenous resident.</p>
        <p>The &quot;domestic unit&quot; may he said to occur in those  groups where each wife in a polygamous family is allotted her own living space  comprising of one or more dwelling units set within their own system of  courtyards (Illustration 1).</p>
        <p>The &quot;homestead&quot; may be defined as that area  occupied by a nuclear family, either monogamous or polygamous, under the  leadership of one person, usually the husband and/or father. Such a homestead  consists of a number of dwelling units which may be grouped into separate  domestic units but which will usually involve the disposition of the family's  constituent parts according to socially predetermined patterns which recognise  and formalise the status of individuals within that family (Illustration 2).  Although considerations of &quot;homestead&quot; normally also involve  elements of locality, these need not be conclusive, as in cases where the proximity  of the constituent domestic units of a homestead was either made impossible by  development of the settlement form itself, or was made undesirable by social  custom.</p>
        <h5>ARCHITECTURE  AS A LANGUAGE</h5>
        <p>A criticism which has been levelled against architecture from time  to time by linguistic purists has been the former's appropriation of the term  &quot;vernacular&quot;. This is a word generally associated with  language, but more currently it has also been applied to certain genres of  domestic and pre-industrial buildings. The reasons for this are simple. Not  only do architects themselves use the concept of a &quot;language of  architecture&quot; (Viollet-le-Duc 1859), but some close parallels may also  be drawn between these two disciplines. Both are possessed of a basic  vocabulary of expression; both are subject to certain set rules of grammar;  both may be considered to be systems of symbols and codifications; and both may  be classified as having &quot;high&quot; and &quot;vernacular&quot;  branches.</p>
        <p>The similarities do not cease there. Language, or more generally  &quot;communication&quot;, is widely accepted by social scientists as an  important, socialising factor in the induction of new members into a community  (Piaget 1962). Other unspoken, and even unconscious, value systems exist as  part of the socialising process: role playing for example or some social taboos  such as incest. In the case of architecture it may be seen that society  attaches values to the organisation of living spaces, to the forms and even to  the textures they are given and that these tend to vary as one moves from  society to society (Levi-Strauss 1968). Thus there would appear to be some  justification for the claim that architecture provides an unspoken and  generally unconscious language for the classification of man's built  environment. This means that the disorientation experienced by new visitors to  a country may be ascribed to both their differing perception of spatial systems  and of building forms as well as their unfamiliarity with local languages and  social customs.</p>
        <p>It is possible to assume therefore that, over the years, the  expression of architecture has undergone a series of changes where current  value systems and symbologies are linked to those of previous eras and  societies. The idioms of Victorian architecture, for example, are not so far  removed from those of current society that a modern person would not be able to  assign values to its spaces and forms with a reasonable degree of accuracy. On  the other hand, the specialised knowledge of a historian or an archaeologist  might he required to decipher the spatial distributions of a Hellenic dwelling  or a Roman courtyard house.</p>
        <p>It has similarly been found that various rural groups in southern Africa also developed their own value systems of spatial  organisation. Venda  fortified villages, for example, were last used some six or seven generations  ago and are believed to have been largely the product of colonial land wars  which beset the region during the nineteenth century. Current Venda  settlement, on the other hand, has been moulded by a different set of social,  economic and environmental pressures. Yet current research has shown that  present-day Vendas  are able to read the barest signs of settlement by their ancestors and give  them spatial significance. As was the case with the Victorian villa, the idioms  of nineteenth century Venda  settlement are not so far removed from those used currently as to require  specialised historical knowledge in order to interpret them.</p>
        <p>Today visitors approaching a rural domestic unit or homestead will  often be informed about the residents within before a single word has been  exchanged. Provided they are also familiar with the &quot;language&quot;  used, they will be able to determine their cultural background, how many wives  are part of the extended family, the status of each within the family  hierarchy, whether their husband is still living, the wealth and status of the  family, the location of the kitchen, living and sleeping areas, the method of  approach visitors should follow and even their etiquette. In some regions of  southern Africa it is also possible to  ascertain whether the husband is chief or commoner, the location of his  mother's dwelling and the spaces reserved for cooking, for entertainment, for  work, for meeting and for judgment and mediation (Frescura 1985).</p>
        <p>The outside spaces of settlements, although not always clearly  defined in architectural terms, are subject to a high degree of specialisation.  In the first place there exists a measure of interchangeability between inside  and outside space with seasonality, weather and individual preference acting as  the major determinant factors. Secondly, outside spaces tend to he defined by a  highly developed set of visual signals and territorial statements such as low  walls, kerbs, shelving, decorative textures and visual lines of connection  (Illustration 3). Finally the question of family privacy, which does not really  arise in the case of interior spaces, is established by custom and regulated by  architectural forms and visual messages.</p>
        <h5>DEFINING  THE GRAMMAR OF RURAL SETTLEMENT</h5>
        <p>A number of major themes run like threads through the fabric of  southern Africa's rural settlements. These  involve the relationships between the individual elements of settlement, and  between them and the settlement as a whole. Rural society appears to be highly  ordered in this respect and many interpersonal relationships which are  internalised in the traditions and culture of a people are often mirrored in  the organisation of their habitat to the extent that the individual's status  within their society or peer group will predetermine their location within the  overall settlement structure.</p>
        <p>In general terms it may be said that the interpretation of space  in southern African settlement is subject to four major considerations:</p>
        <ol type="a">
          <li>Differentiations  of hierarchy.</li>
          <li>Approach  and orientation of aspect.</li>
          <li>Location  and orientation of the cattle byre.</li>
          <li>The  location and orientation of the burial site of the homestead head.</li>
        </ol>
        <h5>SOCIAL  HIERARCHIES AS GENERATORS OF SETTLEMENT FORM</h5>
        <p>Although theoretically it should be possible to claim that each  different region in southern Africa is possessed of a settlement form which is  uniquely its own, in reality it will be seen that generally only two themes  predominate: those where social hierarchies are resolved in terms of &quot;left&quot;  and &quot;right&quot;, and those where these are resolved in terms of  &quot;front&quot; and &quot;back&quot; distributions.</p>
        <h5>THE  CONCEPT OF &quot;LEFT&quot; AND &quot;RIGHT&quot;</h5>
        <p>The concept of &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot;  has been recorded as existing in both Sotho/Tswana and Nguni societies and is  based upon the hierarchical relationship perceived to exist between the &quot;Head&quot;  and subsequent wives of a polygamous marriage. The interpretation of which hand  is assumed to be ascendant varies from group to group and is the subject of  numerous historical anecdotes or myths. Generally speaking it may be said that  the belief that &quot;right&quot; is superior to &quot;left&quot; is grounded  in the rural metaphor of a warrior wielding his spear with his right hand and  his shield with his left (Illustration 4). The right is therefore assumed to  have an ascendance over the left being &quot;active&quot; and &quot;aggressive&quot;,  whilst the left is &quot;passive&quot; and &quot;defensive&quot;.  On the other hand where the converse is held to be true and &quot;left&quot;  is held to be ascendant over &quot;right&quot;, this is explained by a  person placing their right hand over their head and stating that the right hand  serves or protects the &quot;head&quot;. In such cases it was also found  that wives were not placed in &quot;Right Hand&quot; and &quot;Left  Hand&quot; Houses but were either in the &quot;First House&quot; or  the &quot;Right Hand House&quot; and at no time was the right hand  described as being inferior to the left. This social hierarchy finds reflection  in the form of the settlement in that the &quot;First&quot; or &quot;Head&quot;  wife will be located at the head of the settlement, in a central position and on  axis with the entry to the homestead. Second and subsequent wives are then  located alternatively on either side of the first wife in descending order of  importance. Such settlements are normally circular and axial in nature which  not only emphasizes the importance of the first wife, but also stresses the  fact that her dwelling, the Great Hut, is also the formal abode of her husband,  the head of the homestead. The other wives will each have their own dwellings  as well as, in some instances, their own separate cooking facilities or even  their own separate households.&nbsp; In such  cases conjugal rights are meant to be enjoyed in strict rotation with the  husband visiting each wife in turn. This stands in sharp contrast to Venda social  custom where the husband enjoys his own dwelling quite independent of any wives  he might have. A Venda  wife will take up abode in her husband's quarters until such a time as she  falls pregnant. At approximately the sixth month of term she is allowed to  return to her own dwelling. Venda male informants showed some reluctance at the  prospect of co-habiting with more than one wife simultaneously, something that  their Nguni and Sotho, Tswana counterparts thought little of, and at least one  expressed the fear that, should two of his wives fall pregnant at the same  time, he would be summoned to appear before his chief, be accused of behaving  &quot;like a dog&quot; and fined a cow for his pains.</p>
        <p>Strictly speaking therefore, in Nguni, Sotho and Tswana society,  the husband does not have a dwelling in his own right, and although his  domicile is held to be that of the first wife, in reality even that belongs to,  and is the responsibility of, the woman concerned. This becomes an important  factor in our later comparison with those settlements where hierarchy is  expressed in terms of &quot;front&quot; and &quot;back&quot;.</p>
        <p>Although considerations of &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot;  are basic to both Sotho/Tswana and Nguni settlement the form of the settlement  itself can however vary greatly while still permitting individual elements to  find their socially predetermined positions within the whole.</p>
        <p>The Sotho/Tswana of the northern    Cape and the western and the northern Transvaal are known to have built their settlement in the  shape of an open fan with an open space, the khotla, being located in its  centre. The first wife of the senior man was sited at the head of the homestead  on the central axis of the settlement directly opposite the main entry to the  central space, with subsequent junior wives being located alternatively to her  left and her right. The homesteads of his brothers or other members of his  retinue would then also he located alternatively to the left and right of his  abode according to their descending order of status in relation to him. They,  in their turn, would also follow a left-right hierarchy in the distribution of  their wives within their own individual residences (Illustration 5).</p>
        <p>Today the circular fan pattern has fallen largely into disuse,  although individual homesteads tend to follow a linear form along lines of land  contour, the same considerations of left and right have prevailed and are still  being maintained by succeeding generations.</p>
        <p>Sotho-like fan shaped settlements have also been recorded among  the South Ndebele of the Transvaal where the  direct influence of their Sotho/Tswana neighbours has been clearly evident.  Today few of these survive and the South Ndebele, like their Sotho neighbours,  now appear to build mostly linear settlements which follow the lines of land  contour. Like them, they also have retained their &quot;left-right&quot;  preoccupation with hierarchy.</p>
        <p>An interesting elaboration of the South Ndebele distribution of  &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; was recorded in the 1950s  by Meiring, at the Msiza homestead on the farm Hartbeesfontein, north of  Pretoria, a site more popularly known in its time as &quot;Speelman's Kraal&quot;  (Meiring 1955) (Illustration 6). Here, once their sons had achieved adulthood  and married, they took up positions in close proximity to their mother's  domestic unit and in doing so, also established hierarchical positions among  themselves based upon the traditional left-right relationship. Current research  among other South Ndebele homesteads (Frescura 1981) has shown that, whilst  such a practice is still being largely observed, the economics of land  management and the requirements of space are today beginning to have an adverse  effect upon their architectural patterns. Although many settlements are still  being planned out along historical lines, they are also beginning to make small  but significant departures from the layouts of their parent homesteads.</p>
        <p>Research conducted nearly 30 years later among the self-same Msiza  group showed that in 1952, once they had relocated to their new home at  KwaMatabeleng, their initial settlement had maintained the old left-right distribution.  However, once male children had begun to settle down with families of their  own, then this pattern was disrupted by the location of the planting lands and  the economic need to keep these intact from human settlement (Illustration 7).</p>
        <p>Among many Nguni groups the traditional circular pattern of  settlement may still be found to a large extent, even in some cases of smaller  family groups.</p>
        <p>During the course of current research, the concept of &quot;left&quot;  and &quot;right&quot; was also found to apply in the context of the  individual dwelling unit, where differentiation was made between the man's and  the woman's side of the internal habitat. The rules governing such a  distribution were however found to vary from group to group, and in fact did  not necessarily coincide with their respective application of &quot;left&quot;  and &quot;right&quot; hierarchies in the larger context of the  settlement. The notable exception to this rule was found to be the Venda among  whom no such distinction existed within the individual dwelling unit or, for that  matter, in the homestead (Illustration 8).</p>
        <h5>THE  CONCEPT OF &quot;FRONT&quot; AND &quot;BACK&quot;</h5>
        <p>While it is generally true that the concept of &quot;left&quot;  and &quot;right&quot; as a determinant of hierarchy within a settlement  was found to be fairly consistent in its application among southern Africa's  indigenous groups, the same thing cannot be claimed of the concept of &quot;front&quot;  and &quot;back&quot;. Although an awareness of the latter was perceived  to exist in the settlements of Nguni, Sotho/Tswana and Venda alike,  their individual interpretations differed so radically as to make it impossible  to establish any generalised rules of application.</p>
        <p>In the case of the Nguni, both northern and southern groups  practice a social structure which inhibits marriage within their immediate  kinship circle. Unlike the Sotho/Tswana where the preferred marriage is between  first cousins on the mother's brother's side, the Nguni generally marry outside  their kinship circle. Thus we find that the traditional Nguni settlement has a  built-in schism line between the older generation (at the back) who will  continue their residence in the parent homestead and the young (in the front)  who will eventually hive off elsewhere and start separate homesteads in their  own right (Illustration 9).</p>
        <p>In the case of the Sotho/Tswana fan-shaped settlement a  hierarchical differentiation may be said to exist between those homesteads  which are closest to the central common, that is to say the residences of the  parents, and those homesteads located on the external perimeter being the residences  of the children (Illustration 5). Although strictly speaking, such a  differentiation can best be described as one existing between the &quot;centre&quot;  and the &quot;perimeter&quot;, this is only valid for as long as the  settlement form remains circular. Once the settlement breaks up into individual  homesteads which tend to follow a linear pattern along the contour lines, a  trend in Sotho/Tswana settlement which has accelerated in more recent times,  then it will be seen that the traditional centre-perimeter apposition will  become translated into one based upon the concept of front and back. In the  context of the individual traditional Sotho/Tswana domestic unit, the  opposition has always been one between &quot;front&quot; and &quot;back&quot;,  where the dwelling of the parents is located in the fore court or lobe of the  homestead whilst the areas of privacy, of cooking and of children's residence,  have been located to the rear. This is a pattern of settlement which  archaeologists have termed as &quot;bilobial&quot; (Maggs 1972)  (Illustration 10).</p>
        <p>In both Nguni and Sotho/Tswana cases however, it may be  successfully argued that what front-back appositions that do arise are in  reality no more than form variants resulting from the circularity of the larger  settlement. In both cases also, front-back appositions only arise between  parents and siblings and in no example was this found to be the case between  husband and wife, or wives.</p>
        <p>The instance of the Venda can be said to be unique in the context  of southern African settlement for whilst all other groups use a system of  hierarchical differentiation based upon their concept and individual  interpretation of &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot;, in  their case all distinction is made in terms of &quot;front&quot; and  &quot;back&quot; in establishing the relative status of husband against  wife, father against son, chief against people.</p>
        <p>Such a differentiation becomes evident at the level of a humble  domestic unit where the dwellings and activity centers of the wife, or wives,  will be located before and preferably downhill from those of the father and  family head. Similarly the homesteads of a man's sons will be placed in front  of and downhill from the parent homestead whilst in themselves repeating the  pattern set by the father's. The settlement of a Venda chief or headman will  tend to follow the same basic pattern as that applicable to his people,  excepting that the process of ascent to his quarters will be complicated by the  introduction of defensive ramparts and narrow access passages, all designed to  protect his person in the case of attack. An old Shona proverb, also found to  be in use in Venda,  states that &quot;to climb a mountain one must go zig-zag&quot;  (Plangger 1974), an obvious allegorical reference to their chiefs and,  indirectly, to the pyramidal structure of their settlement patterns. This is equally  applicable to commoners at the level of a small nuclear family. Thus, in many  ways the humblest of Venda  domestic units acts as a microcosm of their society as a whole (Illustration  11).</p>
        <p>Venda settlement is also differentiated from  that of their neighbours in southern Africa by  the fact that, in a polygamous marriage, the Venda father retains the use of a  dwelling unit in his own right, with its own courtyards and, in some cases, its  own granary. This contrasts sharply with the practice of most other southern  African groups where, under similar circumstances, the dwelling of the first  wife is considered to be that of the father as well although, strictly  speaking, he has no dwelling of his own and is expected to rotate his residency  equally among those of his wives. On the other hand, the head of a Venda homestead  will be visited by his wives at his dwelling. This also means that, with the  exception of the Head wife, no hierarchy of settlement is followed in  determining the position of the domestic units of second and subsequent wives,  their location being a matter of personal preference and negotiation with the  head of the homestead. The Head or First Wife will usually be identified by the  fact that the main path of access to the homestead leads directly to her  domestic unit.</p>
        <h5>OF  DIFFERENCES ... AND SIMILARITIES</h5>
        <p>Much has been said over the years about the alleged &quot;ethnic&quot;  composition of the indigenous population of southern Africa.  In this respect, white historians and anthropologists have laid particular  stress upon the many supposed differences, material, cultural and linguistic,  which they perceived to exist among the various regional groups. Such  differences have, over the years and possibly with the abettance of academics,  been internalised into many of the misconceptions which white society tends to  labour under to the present day. Yet if greater recognition were to be given to  the similarities which link cultures (Levi-Strauss 1968), then it is probable  that what divergences do exist will be perceived to be no more than regional  variants, much as those existing between Cornishman and Yorkshireman,  Englishmen both.</p>
        <p>Certainly were architecture and language of settlement the only  criteria available, then it would be seen that if &quot;cultural&quot;  divisions do indeed exist, then they are not along the traditionally supported  lines between the Nguni and the Sotho/Tswana, but rather along those between  Venda society on the one hand and that of the Nguni, the Sotho and the Tswana  on the other (Illustrations 9 and 12). To a certain extent this viewpoint has  been supported by other researchers in the field (Kuper 1980), some of whom  have gone so far as to suggest that the Venda represent a southern and  ancient extrusion of the Shona people. The tabulation of such differences in  settlement and spatial perception certainly makes a strong case for the  existence of one greater and homogeneous body of indigenous South Africans.</p>
        <h5>SOME  BASIC DIFFERENCES OF SETTLEMENT</h5>
        <p>The&nbsp; differences between Venda and  Nguni/Sotho/Tswana settlement or, conversely, the similarities linking Nguni,  Sotho and Tswana, would appear to hinge upon the following major issues:</p>
        <ol type="1">
          <li><strong>Outward  form of settlement</strong>. Venda  settlement patterns are linear and follow the ascending lines of contour while  the Nguni/Sotho/Tswana settlement is traditionally circular.</li>
          <li><strong>Approach  and entry</strong>. The  approach and entry path into a Venda  homestead is laid to follow a deliberate dis-axial or &quot;zig-zag&quot;  route, while that of the Nguni/Sotho/Tswana is along a strong central axis.</li>
          <li><strong>Location  of residences for the wives</strong>.  Among the Venda  the position of the wives' individual domestic units is determined by communal  negotiation and historically there appears to be no attempt at creating a  balanced plan. The layout of historical settlement among the  Nguni/Sotho/Tswana, on the other hand, follows a strong basic ordering about a  central, vertically imposed axis.</li>
          <li><strong>Hierarchical  differentiations within the family unit</strong>. Among the Venda these are expressed on the settlement plan in  terms of &quot;front&quot; and &quot;back&quot;; among the  Nguni/Sotho/Tswana these are expressed on the settlement plan terms of  &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot;.</li>
          <li><strong>Hierarchical  differentiation between wives</strong>. Among the Venda  there is no hierarchical differentiation drawn from the location of dwellings  of the second and subsequent wives. Among the Nguni/Sotho/Tswana, on the other  hand, the position of dwellings belonging to each wife is subject to a siting  plan predetermined by her status within the polygamous hierarchy.</li>
          <li><strong>Residence  of the husband</strong>. Among  the Venda  the husband has his own private dwelling, while among the Nguni/Sotho/Tswana  this is generally recognised to be that of his first wife or his mother.&nbsp; In theory, however, he is expected to take up  abode in rota with each wife in her own separate residence.</li>
          <li><strong>Connubial  visitation</strong>. The  wives of a Venda  husband visit his dwelling each in their own turn and do not leave until such a  time as they have fallen pregnant. Among the Nguni/Sotho/Tswana the husband  visits individual wives in their own dwellings regularly and irrespective of  whether more than one of them has fallen pregnant at any one time.</li>
          <li><strong>Placing  of the cattle byre</strong>.  The Venda  cattle byre is located to the side of the homestead, not within it, and is  generally accessible to both genders. Among the Nguni/Sotho/Tswana the cattle  byre is usually incorporated centrally within the homestead and is not  accessible to women who are still at the age of menstruation.</li>
          <li><strong>Settlement  as a reflection of inheritance hierarchy</strong>. Among the Venda  settlement does not necessarily reflect a filial inheritance hierarchy; among  the Nguni/Sotho/Tswana it is a direct reflection of this.</li>
          <li><strong>Hierarchical  differentiation between husband and wife</strong>. The Venda  pattern of settlement is determined by the apposition of &quot;husband&quot; as  against &quot;wife&quot; or &quot;wives&quot;; among the Nguni/Sotho/Tswana it  is determined by the apposition of &quot;wife&quot; as against  &quot;wife&quot;.</li>
          <li><strong>Burial  patterns.</strong> Upon  his death, the burial of the head of a Venda homestead takes place behind  or near his former domicile or dwelling unit; the head of a Nguni/Sotho/Tswana  homestead will be buried in or near his cattle byre.</li>
          <li><strong>Hierarchical  subdivisions of space within the individual dwelling unit.</strong> No special definition of space is known  to exist within the individual Venda  dwelling; the Nguni/Sotho/Tswana, on the other hand, apply considerations of  both &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot;, of &quot;front&quot;  and &quot;back&quot;, and of &quot;male&quot; and &quot;female&quot;  in their allocation of seating and living space within the individual unit.</li>
          <li><strong>Nomenclature  of architectural elements. </strong>The nomenclature of the component elements of homesteads belonging to the Venda ruling  class differs considerably from that applied to the homesteads of ordinary  people, while in the case of the Nguni/Sotho/Tswana the homesteads of both the  ruling class and the ordinary people share a common nomenclature.</li>
          <li><strong>Class  differentiation in architectural patterns.</strong> The homestead architecture of the Venda ruling class is qualitatively  different from that of the common people, having a monopoly of some distinctive  materials of construction and dwelling forms but sharing in the same basic  principles of settlement organisation. Thus it may be said that their  architecture acts as a direct reflection of social status and as such has  become internalised in the structure of their society. The homestead  architecture of the Nguni/Sotho/Tswana ruling class is not qualitatively  different from that of the common people being but larger scale versions of the  same settlement, sharing the same form, basic spatial organisation, materials  of construction and dwelling forms.</li>
          <li><strong>Position  of married sons in the settlement.</strong> In Venda  society married sons establish homesteads in front and below that of their  father's, while the Nguni/Sotho/Tswana place their homesteads behind that of  their mother's. Among some Nguni groups this is usually a temporary arrangement  prior to the son breaking off altogether and establishing a separate homestead  elsewhere.</li>
        </ol>
        <h5>SOME  SIMILARITIES OF SETTLEMENT</h5>
        <p>In spite of these differences, Nguni/Sotho/Tswana and Venda groupings  share in some strong similarities of settlement.</p>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>Both  built environments are the product of settled agrarian communities of cattle  herders.</li>
          <li>Both  groups employ cattle as a source of wealth and as a means of gaining children.</li>
          <li>Both  groups use the concept of &quot;front&quot; and &quot;back&quot;  to establish a hierarchical differentiation between parents and children  although their individual interpretations of this do not necessarily coincide.</li>
          <li>Both  groups incorporate an awareness of &quot;top&quot; and &quot;bottom&quot;  in the initial placing of a settlement in a topography.</li>
          <li>In  the case of both groups, approach to a settlement is made from the lower or  &quot;bottom&quot; level.</li>
          <li>The  position of the &quot;first&quot; or head wife is recognized and her  dwelling or domestic unit is given a dominant position within the overall  settlement.</li>
          <li>Both  recognise that fundamental differences exist between the life of rural man and  that of rural woman.</li>
          <li>The  same basic principles of settlement organisation are applied to the homesteads  of their ruling classes as well as those of common people.</li>
        </ol>
        <h5>APPROACH  AND ORIENTATION OF ASPECT</h5>
        <p>Although much of the discussion has, thus far, centred upon&nbsp; the distinctions inherent in the appositions  between &quot;left and right&quot; and &quot;front and back&quot;,  none of these terms should be seen as representing absolute values. In fact  both are as subject to regional interpretation as are potentially more  subjective terms as &quot;house&quot; or &quot;homestead&quot;.  The Venda,  for example, will read &quot;front and back&quot; as terms of hierarchy  whereas the Sotho/Tswana will understand it as a transition of spaces from the  public common to the private courtyard.</p>
        <p>The question of &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot;  is an even more complex one, especially when one considers the number of  variants to which it may be subject. In the first place there is no general  agreement among the various southern African groups as to which side is  dominant, although the metaphor upon which it is based appears to be more or  less universally understood. Secondly, the relative positions of &quot;left&quot;  and &quot;right&quot; are also subjective ones and depend largely upon  whether the viewer is looking into a settlement or out of it.</p>
        <p>The question is further complicated by the fact that some groups,  such as the Pondo, would appear to apply one set of criteria in their  settlement patterns and another diametrically opposite set in the case of their  individual dwelling units. If we were to carry the analysis further and, as in  the case of Adam Kuper (1980), introduce other considerations such as the  orientation of the cattle byre, the orientation of aspect, the resident's  stated perception of left and right, and the actual relationships existing  between the households of the different wives, then the number of permutations  achievable becomes such as to make any comparative study almost impossible.  Generally speaking however, it might seem that many of the variations which do  exist, do not necessarily reflect fundamental differences in social attitudes  towards the individual elements of a homestead or settlement, so much as in the  actual relationships existing between the elements themselves. As such,  differences may well have come about as a result of regional environmental  conditions, changing social practices or even deliberate political statements.</p>
        <p>The case of the Zulu is an apt illustration of this point. The  concept of a &quot;Zulu&quot; identity did not exist until the early part of  the nineteenth century when Shaka, son of Senzangakona, took up the work of  Nguni political consolidation begun by Dingiswayo. In about 1816 he was given  the leadership of his father's people, a small Nguni clan which went under the  grandiose name of &quot;the children of Heaven&quot;, the amaZulu. Using  military conquest as a means of sustaining political growth (Morris 1966), he  rapidly engulfed the region, incorporating its numerous clans under his chieftainship  using the name &quot;Zulu&quot; in the sense of a wider Nguni regional  identity.</p>
        <p>Recent archaeological research has revealed that the region's  pre-Shakan Nguni settlements tended to orientate the entrance to their central  cattle byre uphill and facing onto the Great Hut. This is a feature common to  most other Nguni groups and should be seen to have strong pragmatic and  practical roots. One informant in the Transkei more recently explained  that &quot;that is (the direction of) the hut of the father and he has to know  what is going on&quot;. This has remained the general practice of the  Southern Nguni of the Transkei/Ciskei region, the one recorded exception  amongst them being the Bomvana, an immigrant group from Natal, who describe themselves as &quot;building  like the Zulus&quot;.</p>
        <p>However it has been found that post-Shakan settlements have  reversed this order, a condition which has been maintained to the present day.  The reasons for this are self evident. Nguni culture views the byre as an area  of cattle enclosure as well as male gathering and family ceremonial. When  however the Zulu king took the basic Zulu settlement form and translated it  directly into the larger royal village, its function changed, becoming a  military barrack. The function of the byre also changed, becoming an area of  military parade and state ceremonial with only one small portion being  retained, perhaps symbolically, to house the king's prize cattle. Under such  circumstances, the decision to re-orientate the byre by 180&oslash; becomes  understandable for both practical and symbolic reasons. The new byre gate,  having now been faced downhill and away from the Great Hut, or in this case,  the Royal quarters, facilitated the access of troops into the parade ground,  gave the king's residence greater privacy and accentuated the central axis of  the settlement thereby increasing the dominant siting of the Royal enclosure,  an important factor in the ceremonial aspects of occasions of state  (Illustration 13).</p>
        <p>It is not known whether this new settlement order spread to the  homesteads of commoners because the people intuitively wished to emulate their  leadership, because demobilised Zulu soldiers deliberately chose to implement a  settlement form they had come to associate with a Zulu political identity, or  perhaps because Shaka himself codified it. In both instances however, the  question must arise of just how far one had to travel from the core of &quot;Zulu&quot;  culture or authority before this kind of influence began to be cancelled out by  other similar factors. There certainly seems to be a strong element of group  identity involved, with people being able to identify this element of their  architectural culture as being &quot;Zulu-like&quot;, as in the instance  of the Bomvana of the Transkei  and the Tsonga of Mocambique. If this was indeed the case, then we should also  ask to what extent did the conquered Nguni clans revert back to their  pre-Shakan settlement culture once the Zulu kingdom's authority was reduced by  the British in the war in 1879? Current research seems to indicate that, once  established, Zulu builders have opted to retain their settlement form and  post-Shakan spatial values to a great degree in spite of some notable changes  in their social and economic patterns of life.</p>
        <p>The importance of the Zulu's re-orientation of their byre entrance  should also be seen in the context of a centralisation of political power in  the region. Nguni settlement, by the nature of its society and its marriage  norms, tended to be of a scattered nature (De Jager 1964). The orientation of  their byre entrance towards the Great Hut may therefore be seen as a function  of controlling cattle and hence wealth. However the rise of larger Zulu  settlements, acting as Royal residences and military garrisons, created symbols  of a centralised administration and perhaps even the capitals of a nation. This  means that the pastoral function fell by the wayside and was replaced by a  ceremonial one. Parallel developments may be seen to have taken place at an  earlier date among Pedi and Tswana societies whose settlements, perhaps for  slightly different reasons, reached a high degree of centralisation during the  eighteenth century and probably earlier. Both these groups orientate the entry  point to their central activity space, only part of which functions as a byre,  downhill towards the entrance and away from the homestead of the settlement  head.</p>
        <h5>CONVENTIONS  OF PERCEPTION AND ASPECT</h5>
        <p>The twin questions of orientation and aspect are fundamental to  settlement form for they deal directly with the resident's own perception of  dwelling and homestead space and are usually governed by wider social  conventions. Western society, for example, reads its maps with north turned to  the top of the page; similarly architects usually place plans of their  buildings along an accepted north-south orientation, although when matters of  approach or facade are discussed the norm may then be deviated from for the  sake of effect or expediency.</p>
        <p>An interesting insight in this respect was gained during the  course of field work among the Ndundza Ndebele group at KwaMatabeleng. The  village elder, Maselwane Msiza, was shown Meiring's plans of the original Msiza  settlement at Hartbeesfontein which had been vacated by them nearly thirty  years previously. Being an architect, Meiring had drawn his plans with the most  dramatic view in mind, showing the courtyard walls facing towards the reader  (Illustration 6). In the process he had not only inverted the normal north-  south axis but, more importantly in this case, the viewer was looking into the  settlement from the cattle byre outside. Both Maselwane Msiza and the other men  gathered about failed to recognise the plans until one of them, with a flash of  inspiration, suddenly turned them &quot;upside down&quot; so that he was  now viewing the settlement from the inside looking out. Thereafter the group  was not only able to give an account of the buildings but also a detailed  breakdown of their original residents.</p>
        <p>Similar events were experienced in the course of field research in  both Venda  and Botswana  where informants were able to interpret settlements previously recorded by  archaeologists and known to be part of the informant's own historical  background (Illustration 14).</p>
        <h5>CONCLUSIONS</h5>
        <p>This paper has not concerned itself so much with the technical or  aesthetic manifestations of southern African rural architecture as with  establishing the primary principles, or rules of language, which govern its  existence. As such it has concentrated upon the reading of the spatial texts  and subtexts, and how these have been assigned differing values in the context  of various southern African regions and societies. As a result, I have come to  the conclusion that the division perceived by previous researchers to exist  between Nguni and Sotho/Tswana does not exist in architectural terms and that  both groups can be said to share in the same settlement culture. In fact, if  any clear divisions can be said to have emerged in the settlement patterns of  the region, these have not been along the preconceived lines between Nguni and  Sotho/Tswana, but rather between the Nguni, Sotho and Tswana on the one hand  and the Venda on the other.</p>
