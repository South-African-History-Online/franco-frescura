##### POSTSCRIPT

This typology was developed in the context of courses I have delivered to a number of post graduate student groups and historical amateur bodies on the methodology of architectural surveying and conservation. The forms reflected here have been reduced to a simple formula as a means of facilitating field documentation. It has never been published except in the form of student handouts.
