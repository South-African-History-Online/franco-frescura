One of the oft-voiced grievances of the Uitlander community against the Kruger Government was the existence of a "Dynamite Monopoly". This was awarded to a German, Edward Lippert, who obtained sole concession from the ZAR to manufacture dynamite locally. In fact the dynamite was not local, being imported from Germany.

The Johannesburg City Council acquired 1300 morgen on the Farm Klipspruit No 8 for the purpose of building housing for Blacks. This purchase was made during the so-called Depression, when there were still vacant houses at Western Native Township. A competition was held for the planning of a township designed to accommodate 80,000 persons. The township was called Orlando after the then Chairman of the Native Affairs Committee, Orlando Leake. At this time many Blacks were living in such places as Newclare, Sophiatown, Martindale and Prospect Township, in heavily overcrowded conditions.

1939, September 6: South Africa declared war on Germany, three days after Britain. During the next five years influx control regulations were relaxed.

1954: The Johannesburg Municipality created the Housing Division as a separate department, with AJ Archibald as its first Director. Johannesburg submitted an application to the Bantu Services Levy Fund for finances to build a direct access road to Soweto. The South African Railways who, at the time, held a monopoly on transport to this area, opposed this application.  
1955: A Resettlement Board was formed to undertake removal of Blacks from Johannesburg's western areas. This followed the Johannesburg City Council’s refusal to approve the removal of freehold land rights from property owners in Sophiatown.  
1955, February: Over 60,000 persons living in Johannesburg's western areas, including Sophiatown, were removed from their homes at gun-point, in a massive military-style operation, and were resettled in an area which has since become known as Soweto.

1961, May 31: South Africa became a Republic.  
1962: "European" liquor became available legally to the Black community.  
1964: After years of prevarication, permission was finally granted for the construction of a direct access road to Soweto on condition that no public transport would be allowed upon it. This application had been pending for some 10 years. The Tomlinson Commission report was published.
