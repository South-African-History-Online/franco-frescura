NISBETHBAD, so spelt NISBETT BATH, Namibia: LMS; RM; WMMS. It was visited by James Backhouse in January 1840 who reported as follows:

> _"The Wesleyan Missionary Station of Nisbett Bath, is represented in the accompanying cut. It derives its name from a gentleman, formerly resident in India, who contributed liberally toward the re-establishment of the Mission at this place, which had long been abandoned, and from a warm and copious spring which rises among some granite rocks, a few hundred yards from the residence of the Missionary. The settlement consisted, at this time, of the dwellings of the Missionary and Catechist, a chapel, and a few mat-huts. It is situated upon a plain, so elevated, that the peaks of mountains, such as appear lofty at the side of the Orange River, only emerge here, a few hundred feet above the surface of the plain; the rivers run dry in a few hours after rain, and the barometer only rises to about twenty-six inches. The dwelling of the Missionary was a small house, made tolerably comfortable; a portion of its clay walls were erected by some devoted men named Albricht, who laboured in Great Namaqualand many years since, under the auspices of the London Missionary Society. The rooms were, however, much too small for so hot a climate, and the building needed a verandah to protect it from the scorching sun. It is instructive to observe how cheerfully Missionaries and their families put up with inconveniences"._

PABALONG, also spelt PABALLONG, Mount Fletcher, Cape: P 1876  
PACALTSDORP, Georgetown, previously known as HOOGE KRAAL, Cape: LMS 1813; CUSA 1814. It was visited by John Campbell in 1813 and 1819 who reported as follows:

> _"In no part of the colony did I observe a greater alteration or improvement that at the (Khoikhoi) town of Hooge Kraal, now called Pacaltsdorp, which stands at the distance of three miles from George Town._
> 
> _"Dikkop, their captain, (as mentioned in my former Journal, with about sixty of his people,) paid me a visit on my arrival at George Town, on the road to Bethelsdorp, in March, 1813, when he requested a Missionary to be sent to him and to his people. Upon visiting his kraal I found only a few miserable huts, neither gardens nor corn-fields, and the lands remaining in an uncultivated state. No one person could read, and nearly the whole population were dressed in dirty, tattered sheep-skins, and their bodies filthy in the extreme. They knew nothing about God, the Saviour, the Bible, or any thing valuable._
> 
> _"Soon after this visit, Mr. Pacalt, a pious, disinterested, and active Missionary from the London Society, commenced a mission to this people, and continued with them till his death, which happened only a few months before my return to that country._
> 
> _"On revisiting this kraal in 1819, in company with Dr Philip, I found the settlement surrounded by a wall, six feet in height, five feet thick at the bottom, and tapering to the top, the whole length being 6,767 feet. Enclosures for securing their cattle in the night-time were surrounded by walls of the same construction, and measured 938 feet. Their gardens were defended by walls of a similar kind, measuring 3,396 feet. The whole quantity of this kind of fence measuring 11,101 feet._
> 
> _"Their gardens contained peach, apricot, and fig trees, potatoes, pumkins, water-melons, cabbages, beans, peas, Indian corn, etc. Almost the whole of the men and women were on the Sabbath dressed like Europeans. About two hundred generally attended worship; thirty-nine persons were members of the Christian Church; seventy children regularly attended the school, which was taught by a young (Khoikhoi), who had been himself instructed at the same school; six boys and seven girls were learning to write and cipher. At the commencement of the mission, only Dikkop, the chief, possessed a waggon; now the (Khoikhoi) have five waggons, one hundred and fifty oxen, a hundred cows, fifty-three calves, and a considerable number of sheep._

In about 1836 Eugene Casalis visited Pacaltsdorp which he described as follows:

> _"Their village had received from the Boers the name of Hooge-Kraal, from its position on an eminence. In 1813 the natives were under a petty chief, to whom the Cape Government allowed the exercise of a kind of patriarchal authority. The whites called him Dikkop,'Big Head'. Big or not, it was good enough to make him understand the necessity of improving the moral and material condition of his people, and he accordingly made application to the London Society to plant a missionary amongst them._
> 
> _"They sent him a man full of zeal, and of a turn of mind essentially practical. He was of German origin named Pacalt. He made no difficulty about sharing the existence of this despised people. To prevent their scattering, he had the kraal surrounded by a high wall, and traced out two streets in the enclosure. The land was divided amongst the heads of families, who gave an engagement to build themselves houses in line, and to each cultivate a garden. In the middle were erected the church, the school, the missionary's house, and other constructions of public utility. At the end of the sacred building, almost on the sea-shore, a tower was built, whence visitors could enjoy a view of the sea. It served also to lodge them for the night. I found from experience, however, that it was almost impossible to get any sleep there, owing to the number of screech owls who chose to mingle their lugubrious cries with the roar of winds and waves._

PELLA, Cape: LMS 1802-1820; Mor 1871; RM. John Campbell visited it on 13 September 1813 and reported as follows:

> _"The Namacquas live in low circular huts, like the Corannas, composed of branches of trees bent, and stuck into the ground at both ends, with mats made of rushes thrown over them. They differ from the Corannas in this, that in the inside they dig about a foot, or a foot and a half into the ground, which they lie in to protect them, they say, from the wind. A more barren looking spot can hardly be conceived than Pella, all around being white sand, interspersed with a few bushes; two sides of which space, the N. and E. are bounded by high, rugged, black mountains"._

PHILIPPOLIS, OFS: LMS 1820-1848; SPG 1865. It was visited by James Backhouse in June 1839 who reported the following:

> _"It consists of a single street of cottages, a chapel, and a number of mat huts; the latter are scattered on a flat at one side of the village, on which are also, the cattle kraals, and the foundation of a school-house. The place is surrounded by remarkable hills of basalt._
> 
> _"At the time of our visit, there were sixty mat huts at Philippolis. The chapel which was of stone, was built in Dutch style; it stood at the head of the town, near a stony hillock. The house of the Missionary, which was a very simple, thatched one, and only divided to the height of the walls, was of brick, and had a few trees behind it. The rest of the houses were of mud, and many of them were so neglected, as to be half unroofed. Many of the people living in mat huts, were possessed of oxen and wagons._
> 
> _"... in the forenoon we called on Adam Kok, who was from home when we arrived: he was a young-looking man, of plain features and middle size; he was dressed in a drab, duffle jacket, bound and buttoned with black, and trousers that were the worse for wear. His dwelling was a small thatched cottage, built of clay, but far superior to the mat-huts of the generality of the people._
> 
> _"Snow fell last evening, and remained on the ground till mid-day. We were much occupied in writing, which it was difficult to effect from the cold. The houses were badly constructed for warmth, and fuel was scarce. I walked a few times, enveloped in a karross of Coney-fur, among the stony hills, to acquire warmth"._

Eugene Casalis also visited Philippolis, probably in the 1840s, and reported as follows:

> _"We thought we had bid adieu to the colonists, it might be for years; but we were not yet entirely beyond their reach. At a short day's march from the river there was a missionary station called Philippolis, so named in honour of our venerable friend at Cape Town. Some people were living there at the same time whose features and hair recalled our own race and that of the (Khoikhoi). They were, alas, the fruit of illicit relations between our colonists and their native servants._
> 
> _"We found at Philippolis a work carried on under the direction of a M. Kolbe which was interesting in many respects. There was a large chapel filled on Sundays with attentive hearers, and well-managed schools for boys and girls. Dutch being universally spoken by these people, the teaching was carried on without difficulty. Several had built themselves good houses._

Emil Holub visited the Mission in August 1872 where he reported as follows:

> _"Two hours later we reached Philippolis. The aspect of this place was most melancholy. The winter drought had parched up all the grass, alike in the valley and on the surrounding hills, leaving the environs everywhere brown and bare. Equally dready-looking were the square flat-roofed houses, about sixty in number, and nearly all quite unenclosed, that constituted the town; whilst the faded foliage of a few trees near some stagnant pools in the channel of a dried-up brook did nothing to enliven the depressing scene. The majority of the houses being unoccupied, scarcely a living being was to be seen, so that the barrenness of the spot was only equalled by its stillness._

PHILIPTON, Seymour, Cape: CUSA 1829; LMS. The mission church was burnt down as the result of hostilities during 1846. James Backhouse visited in January 1839 and reported as follows:

> _"Philipton, at this period, consisted of a large, plain building used as a chapel and schoolroom, and of humble cottages, occupied by the Missionaries, James Read senior and junior, and of still humbler ones, with a few huts, inhabited by (Khoikhoi), (Mfengu) and other people. A large, temporary shed of boughs and reeds, had been erected for the present occasion, on the green, which was enclosed on three sides by the buildings already described. A (Xhosa) Interpreter residing here, kept an eating-house, and supplied a basin of coffee, and a slice of bread and butter for twopence"._

Thomas Baines visited this location in November 1851 when he found Philipton in ruins:

> _"We passed the ruined village of Philipton, 'the hot bed of sedition', as our veteran commander had but too much reason to call it. Alas, how sadly changed since my last visit! The chapel, in which the later Mr Freeman had then preached, was a roofless and blackened ruin. The house, in which the venerable missionary Read, since also deceased, had so kindly entertained me, as well as the rest of the village, was destroyed, and the only building remaining in its pristine condition was the unfinished chapel, the walls of which had no combustible material about them"._

PIRIE, also spelt PERIE, King William's Town, Cape: GMS 1830; UFS 1844. Founded in 1830 by Dr John Ross, the station stood at the site where the Rev Vanderkemp had built his house some years earlier. James Backhouse visited it in February 1839 and reported as follows:

> _"The Mission premises at Pirie consisted of a plain house, of unhewn basalt, and a little mud-walled chapel. There were upwards of forty (Xhosa) kraals within three miles of this place._
> 
> _"Adjacent to the chapel there was a piece of ground, which was once a (Xhosa) cattle-kraal, and in which there were still to be seen, the traces of the subterranean granaries, which are made in such situations, that they may be easily protected from robbery. The openings at the top are just sufficient to admit a man. When these pits are filled, they are closed by means of a flat stone, which is covered carefully with earth, to exclude dirt and moisture; they are scooped out so as each to hold from six to eight bushels of grain. The grain acquires an unpleasant taste, and will not vegetate after being kept in these places. The number of these granaries in a kraal is sometimes considerable. It is notorious, that, before the war, when commandoes, or patroles came into (Transkei) in search of stolen cattle, they frequently robbed the (Xhosa) of their hoarded grain, to feed themselves and their horses._
> 
> _"Every pretext for levying fines seems to be laid hold of, in this country; it is even extended to the man whose wife dies, if he do not bury her clothes with her, and burn down the hut in which she died, as well as the huts of his other wives, and retreat alone into the woods for about ten days, and afterwards erect a dwelling in another place. At the Missionary Institutions the people are in some measure protected from these customs: at Pirie a man had been persuaded to leave the hut undisturbed in which his wife died; he, however erected another for himself and his children, at a short distance, and converted the old one into a calf-house. Each wife has a separate hut and a separate garden._
> 
> _"The common size of a (Xhosa) hut is twelve feet in diameter, and seven feet in height, but those of the Chiefs are much larger. The form of the huts is a depressed hemisphere; they are built by the women, who take about three days for the purpose. Near the hut, a sort of safe is sometimes erected, for the preservation of pumpkins, and in which Indian-corn is also occasionally stored. It is made of sticks interwoven in beehive form, and plastered with cow-dung, and is placed on stakes about four feet high, to protect the contents from damp, and from insects, and other vermin"._

PLATBERG, also spelt PLAATBERG, OFS: WMS 1826; Bn. James Backhouse visited it in July 1839 and reported as follows:

> _"The dwellings of the people at Plaatberg, were chiefly hartebeest houses, of tall reeds, plastered with mud: a few had better cottages; and two or three of their houses were built of brick, in European style. But even in one of these, which had a fireplace and a chimney, the fire, according to the common custom of the coloured natives, was made in the midst of the floor. In consequence of this practice, both the houses and people are far from cleanly. Their furniture consisted of a bedstead, a few boses, some stools generally with seats made of strips of prepared skins, a few iron pots, a kettle, with a few basins, bottles, etc"._

In 1848 Platberg was visited by William Shaw. His impressions were published by Samuel Broadbent:

> _"We left Thaba 'Nchu on the 4th, in the evening, and arrived at Plaat-Berg at noon on the 5th instant. Here Mr Giddy resides, and continues to labour diligently to promote the welfare of the people. This is a settlement of great capabilities of an agricultural kind. The village is greatly improved since I was last here; the people have built themselves very good and substantial houses, after the colonial fashion. A large number of gardens and orchards are will enclosed; and hundreds, if not thousands, of fruit trees give the whole a very interesting rural appearance"._

POST RETIEF, Cape: SPG 1849. Thomas Baines visited it in October 1849 and wrote the following account of the Mission and its outpost at Didinia:

> _"The buildings of this post, unlike that at Zwart Kei, are of solid and substantial stonework, and surrounded by a wall, in some places sixteen feet in height, with loopholes at intervals all round it. It is at present tenanted only by Mr Wilson, and a widow who lives with her son in another suite of rooms, the rest of the apartments being unoccupied. But in case of a war it would form an excellent rallying point for the neighbouring farmers, as well as a place of security for their goods and families; several hundred head of cattle might also be shut within its walls._
> 
> _"Sunday, 14. Walked over to the church in a kloof of the Didima about four miles from the Post. A stone building has been commenced, but, for want of funds, is not yet completed; so that service is at present held in a small thatched cottage, one end of which is fitted with a reading desk of most primitive construction covered with green baize, and printed papers of the Creed, the Lord's Prayer and the Commandments suspended over it."_

> _"Preparations for departure from Thlotse were soon made, and a week afterwards Mr Balfour and his catchiest were encamped at Sekubu - the name of the village nearest their ground -busily engaged in hut-building._
> 
> _"The site of this new mission is a very fine one. It is at the foot of a high ridge jutting out from a leading spur of the Malutis, at the back of which are several interesting (San) caves; and the view from the crest of the ridge is one of the wildest and most magnificent to be found anywhere in the world. At any rate, such is the opinion of those travellers who have seen it. A number of scattered kraals and villages are spread all round, the inhabitants of which are some of the rudest, most savage, and most thoroughly heathen in the whole of Basutoland._
> 
> _"Within three months several rondavels were finished, and the foundations of a small but substantial church of stone put in. A peach orchard was laid out, enclosed with a sod wall, and planted with young trees; ..._
> 
> _"Mr Balfour had fortunately succeeded in securing the services of a clever American, living not far off on the borders of the Free State, who "knew a great many traders, and could turn his hand to anything". This man engaged to build a church, and a school-room at a little distance from it, for a very moderate sum, and he carried out his contract faithfully. Two of the rondavels were placed at his disposal, and shortly afterwards he arrived with his wife and family._
> 
> _"In preparing designs and plans for the church and school, as well as in all practical matters connected with the mission, Mr Balfour was greatly aided by the advice and experience of the leading trader of the district, Mr Alfred Ernest Richards. This gentleman, whose head-quarters were at Leribe, most kindly acted as "Clerk of the Works", and spared neither time nor trouble in super-intending the building operations; making also many valuable suggestions, which were the outcome of his own personal experience in the country. The result was that the Epiphany Mission - for such was the dedication of the church at Sekubu - soon possessed neat-looking and thoroughly substantial buildings, superior, in durability at least, to any others then in the diocese._
> 
> _"On Easter Eve we baptized our first little batch of converts, four in number: three Basutos and a Zulu. The chapel was already too small for the congregations of inquirers and heathen who frequented more or less regularly the Sunday services. So in June we pulled down the partition wall between the mission-room and the chapel, thereby enlarging the latter by twelve feet; and in lieu of the former we built an oblong hut of raw brick and sods, which served for study and reception-room"._

The effects of the 1880 Anglo-Basotho conflict were also reported upon by John Widdicombe:

> _"The Church had at the time three Missions in Basutoland: one in the south at Mohale's Hock, under the charge of the Rev. E W Stenson; a second, as the reader already knows, at Sekubu, in the extreme north, where the Rev T Woodman and his sister were working; and my own at Thlotse Heights._
> 
> _"At Sekubu the buildings were rifled of their contents, and the huts burnt. The church and the school being stone structures escaped the flames, and were used as cattle kraals and stables._

> _"The new Native Church at Shawbury is approaching completion, and is to be opened on the 28th October. It is a large and excellent building. When it is opened the old church will be used for school class rooms. Another old building is doomed - the original Mission House. I took a photograph of it. The Rev J Whiteside tells in his "History of the Methodist Church in South Africa" how one nigh, in the time of the Rev WH Garner, a lion put his head over the lower half of the door of this house, and gave a terrific roar, to the great alarm of the inmates. That door has long ago passed away; now the house is beyond repair, and soon only the tale of the lion will remain"._

> _"The dwellings of the missionaries and the chapel were simple, substantial buildings, as were also a mill, that was now standing for want of water, and a smith's shop. There were two or three cottages belonging to Hottentots, but most of the people of the (Khoikhoi) nation resident here, were living in rude huts of boughs and reeds, plastered with mud. These were built in the form of a roof, sloping in two angles, and were generally destitute of windows and chimneys. The (Xhosa) and (Mfengu) inhabited bee-hive shaped huts, of boughs thatched with grass. The settlement of Shiloh contained at this time 384 (Thembu), (Xhosa), (Mfengu), and (San), and 162 (Khoikhoi)"._

The following year, in April 1848, Thomas Baines visited Shiloh and reported the following:

> _"Passing a long row of willow trees shading the furrow by which the waters of the Klipplat were led out to fertilise the lands of the Institution. I entered the village. The Church, School, and the Mission house, were near substantial buildings, over the front of the latter a vine was trained, and in the centre of the square stood a small detached arch in which a bell was suspended. The principal street consisted of a row of brick cottages more or less neatly thatched, and generally with a space before the door smoothed and laid with a mixture of ant-hills and cattle dung, on which were spread beans, mealies, and (maize). And at the end, near a building with a capacious chimney and perforated wall, stood a couple of poles, about twenty feet in height, with another laid across them, and used in the preparation of riems or thongs of hide; several lengths of which, being passed over the horizontal beam with a weight, often a wagon wheel, attached to them, are hoisted into a compact mass by the insertion of a pole between the spokes and allowed, on its withdrawal, to whirl violently round and twist themselves in the contrary direction, till, just as the motion ceases and the wheel is for a moment stationary, the pole is dexterously inserted and the riems twisted as tightly as possible before it is withdrawn, and the operation is continued for the whole day or longer, the riems being greased at intervals till they are considered sufficiently pliable._

> _"A number of hartbeeste houses [43], nearly resembling a thatched roof destitute of walls, inhabited by the (Khoikhoi), and of the more usual hemispherical huts of the (Mfengu) and (Thembu), in some cases surrounded with a screen of bamboos laid side by side, strongly fastened at top and bottom to a twisted withe and plaited on end in a small circular trench, composed the remainder of the village, almost every interval being filled with a kraal for goats or cattle; while, beyond it, appeared extensive patches of cultivated land irrigated by the water from the furrow formerly mentioned._
> 
> _"I had scarcely time to sketch the Institution before the wagons were again in motion, and travelling nearly two miles to the north over a level plain we crossed a little stream called the Hottentots 'Wittle's Rivier', and outspanned beside four or five wattle and daub huts which, on the same authority, were called 'Os Kraal', but, in fact, constituted the nucleus of the rising village of Whittlesea, so named after the birth place of His Excellency Sir Harry Smith"._
> 
> _"The hardbieshuis had nothing to do with the hartebeest. It gets its name from the 'stout reeds', harde biesies, used for covering the timber framework, and was a type of house used by Voortrekkers and stock- farmers. It did not have open sides”._

Baines returned to Shiloh in September 1848.

> _"After operating upon the homely but substantial viands before me I started for Shiloh, and passing the numerous (Xhosa) huts, hartebeeste houses, and other belonging to the more substantial inhabitants who could afford to use mud and half-burned brick, and the well built and extensive mission premises forming a square at the south side of the village, I crossed the two aqueducts by which the lands are irrigated and along the banks of which are planted a long row of fine tall willows with their graceful foliage waving in the breeze, and came to the river just below"._

One year later, in September 1849, Baines was once again there and recorded the following:

> _"Many of the huts have a space before them surrounded by a mat composed of bamboo reeds about seven feet long and an inch thick, laid side by side between two ropes of reed round which small reeds are passed between the bamboos, thus binding them firmly together; another row of fastening about eighteen inches from the first, and perhaps another below that, completes the mat, which is then set upon edge in a circular trench and earth pressed in all round it, rendering it a firm and substantial fence"._

Within two years Shiloh had been reduced to ruins. Baines wrote the following account in December 1851:

> _"... entering the village found the worthy missionary Bonatz standing by the school which two years ago I had seen filled with orderly and attentive (Khoikhoi) and European children. His dwelling was in ruins, but the Church had been rendered incombustible by the removal of the thatch, and, beyond the displacement of patches of plaster by the bullets of the assailants, had sustained but little damage. It had been surrounded, by the direction of Captain Tylden of the Royal Engineers, by a loop-holed wall with bastions at each corner. The windows had been bricked up and loop-holed, and a parapet had been built in front and rear, the gables themselves offering sufficient protection at the ends. From a loop-hole in the northern gable several (Mfengu) were shot, and from the south-western angle poor Webster met his death. The spot where he fell, near the corner of the mission house, being pointed out to me by his cousin, whom I had at first supposed to be the person killed. A few cottages, however, had escaped the general wreck ..."_

SHOSHONG, Botswana: LMS 1862; SPG 1889; HM. It was established by John MacKenzie who also lived there for a number of years as its resident missionary. The following account, written by MacKenzie over a number of years, from about 1859 onwards, describes the construction of the Station's church and its first Mission buildings.

> _"On either side of the ravine Mackenzie and Price built their little two-roomed cottages of wattle and daub"._
> 
> _In 1862 MacKenzie's first residence at Shoshong was somewhat rudimentary._
> 
> _"Although I did not regard Shoshong as my permanent station in 1862, I proceeded, soon after my arrival, to build a temporary hut. I availed myself of the custom of the natives, and asked the chief to point out where I might build, which he was very willing to do. I bought nothing in connection with the building except the labour of the people who assisted me. The structure itself, whose outward appearance was more picturesque than symmetrical, was made of poles, plastered on both sides, and thatched with reeds. The house was divided into three rooms, to which a fourth was afterwards added. The kitchen was outside. Our "windows" were covered with white calico; they were therefore not very bright "eyes" to the house, but allowed of the free passage of "wind", so that our lowly abode was deliciously cool. When the hut was built we expected to occupy it only for a few months: it was however our only dwelling for three years"._
> 
> _By 1865 MacKenzie had set about building a second and more substantial structure._
> 
> _“It was under such circumstances that I resolved to build a better dwelling-house than the wattle-and-daub hut in which I had hitherto dwelt. I had to begin at the beginning, and make the moulds for the bricks. Brick-making was then proceeded with. I next went to the forest with a party of men, and felled timber, which we conveyed to Shoshong to be dressed there. The stone foundation of the house was laid by myself, and I had begun with the bricks, laying them down according to a scheme which I found in a book on the technical arts when a bricklayer who had recently begun trading in ivory and feathers arrived at the station. I got several lessons from him on the practical detail of bricklaying, which I did not find in the book; and he was also kind enough to raise the wall a considerable height before he left. I was equally fortunate in obtaining assistance in the making of doors and window-sashes from English traders, who were on the station at the time. Before I entered the new house at the end of the year, I made the following entry in my note-book:- "Have to record that for many months I cannot remember having been seated for half an hour during the day with either book or newspaper. Continually at out-door work"._

In 1867 work began on the Church at Shoshong:

> _"Early in 1867, I commenced to build a church at Shoshong, having secured the services of two bricklayers. In the absence of a more qualified workman, I undertook the wood work as my department. Macheng was kind enough to furnish me with two regiments of men to assist me in felling the timber. When I followed them to the forest I found they had cut down, according to my orders, some tall trees, but in their ignorance had afterwards destroyed the timber by dividing each tree into several pieces! They said they had done so for the convenience of those who would have to lift the trees into a waggon. I explained to them that they must leave the trees at their greatest length, and expressed my fear that we should not find a sufficient number long enough to span the new church. My assistants, who were chiefly old men, loudly expressed their disapprobation and incredulity. "Why cut such large trees? It was wrong to fell them with an axe. Hitherto they had always been burned down when a man wanted to clear a field for cultivation. After they were felled, it was evident that no human beings could ever lift them. Macheng and the missionary had laid their heads together to impose a burden on them to no purpose", etc. In the end I had to hire other men before a sufficient quantity of timber was cut down. In them I had more willing assistants; but the work of the backwoodsman was hard for such people. I encouraged them by slaughtering an ox for their use; and Khamane, who accompanied me to the forest, killed a giraffe. The tall and resinous tambootie tree, which I selected for beams and rafters, was easily split. The partially dressed logs we conveyed to Shoshong in waggons which were kindly lent me by both Europeans and natives. A pit-saw was next set to work, and after a few lessons two raw natives were able to use it, and sawed almost all the timber for the church. Macheng again assisted me by ordering two regiments of women to cut bundles of grass for thatch. The building, which holds 500 people, was finished by the end of the year"._

Emil Holub visited Shoshong in 1874, and reported on various aspects of the mission:

> _"High above the river-bed on the steep to the left, could be seen the ruins of a European building, the remains of the Hermannsburg Mission Chapel, which had been used as a rampart in one of the native battles, and had been all but destroyed. The mission had previously withdrawn from Shoshong and been replaced by the London Missionary Society, of which the buildings are very comfortable, and form an important settlement, as besides the chapel and school, they include the dwellings occupied by the married native students._
> 
> _"As missionary in Shoshong during the incessant discords in the royal family, he (John MacKenie) had a most difficult position to maintain. But he was the right man in the right place: with much circumspection he acted as mediator between the contending parties; gifted with discretion, and full of sympathy for all that is noble, he succeeded in smoothing down many difficulties, and arousing some-ting like a proper sense of justice and humanity. It is entirely owing to him that Sekhomo's son, Khame, is now one of the best native sovereigns in the whole of South Africa. I had placed our waggon at the south-east end of the town, where it was quickly surrounded by an inquisitive crowd, and there I left it while I paid my visit to the king._
> 
> _"The mission-house of the London Missionary Society lies on the side of the pass, and as we went towards it we saw three groups of houses on the right, forming the central portion of the town, of which another section lies in a rocky hollow on the other side"._
