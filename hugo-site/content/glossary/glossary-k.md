**K**

KAHLAMBA. The indigenous name for the principal mountain range of southern Africa. It stems from the Nguni word isikhahla meaning "thrown down in a heap". Hence its meaning can be read to be a tumble of rocks. Its alternative Sotho/Tswana spelling is Quathlamba. See also DRAKENSBERGE.

KAKEBEENWA. From the Dutch Kakebeen, meaning a jawbone, and wa meaning a wagon. This name is believed to have originated during the nineteenth century from Dutch farm children who, at one time, used to fashion toy wagons from animal jawbones. More commonly called an ox-drawn or Voortrekker wagon, it originated from Sweden, Esthonia, parts of Germany, Holland, Poland and Rumania and was used by Dutch migrant farmers of the Cape interior. Although intended primarily as a means of transport, it also became adapted by the Trekboers as a highly specialised form of travelling dwelling. Ultimately it gained political symbolism, becoming associated with the growth of Boer Republics in the southern African interior.

KIMBERLEY BRICKS. Sun dried or green bricks, also known to indigenous builders as kimmerli bricks. The name arose during the 1870s when, as a result of the diamond rush in the northern Cape, prospectors from many parts of the world came to South Africa. They brought with them a building technology used widely in Australia and the USA, where it is better known as adobe. Indigenous people from all parts of southern Africa were drawn to the diamond fields as labourers, where the transfer of technology obviously took place.
