**A GLOSSARY OF SOUTHERN AFRICAN ARCHITECTURAL TERMS**

**AN ILLUSTRATED SURVEY OF HISTORICAL TERMS APPERTAINING TO THE INDIGENOUS, FOLK AND COLONIAL ARCHITECTURES OF SOUTHERN AFRICA**

_"I am too rude, clearly to define, Or to describe this work in every part, For lack of terms belonging to that art." LYDGATE, John. The Troy-Book. c1412-1420.  
"Dictionaries are like watches; the worst is better than none, and the best cannot be expected to go quite true." Dr Samuel Johnson._

##### INTRODUCTION

This manuscript is the revised draft of a book I originally published in 1987. At that stage its primary intention was to facilitate the teaching of Design and History of Architecture for students who did not use English as a home language. Since then I have extended its scope by including indigenous and Indian Hindu terminology, as well as some urban slang. In due course I am planning to republish this text, probably as an appendix to a broader Guide to Southern African Architecture, but as this is still some way in the offing, I am making it available to students and colleagues. In doing so I hope that they will be able to identify any errors, gaps and silences which may have inadvertently crept in.
