Three types of leggett are used: the Norfolk reed, the long handle combed and the paddle combed. The last is the only one recorded in current use in southern Africa where it is alternatively known as either a dekspan or a idekspan. (Afrikaans: dekspan, or dekspaan, or grasdekspan).

LEG-OF-MUTTON GABLE. Small sweeping gable located at the eaves of a roof, usually built up to accommodate a small zolder window. It forms no sharp angles with the roof and the eaves are run in a continuous undulating sweep over it.

LINGA. (Indian). Literally, a sign, sometimes interpreted as the sign or indicator of gender or sex, especially the male sex organ or phallus. In Hinduism, the linga is associated almost exclusively with Siva. Temples dedicated to Siva generally have a stone or metal linga enshrined as the main object of veneration. A linga may be set into a yoni, a symbol of the female generative organ, that serves as its pedestal, but more importantly, together, the linga and yoni symbolize the unity within duality that is central to much of Hindu thought. Sculpted lingas may be adorned with heads or faces and, occasionally, full figures.
