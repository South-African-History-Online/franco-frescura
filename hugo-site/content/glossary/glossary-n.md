NDEBELE. Sotho/Tswana noun which has been applied in various contexts to indigenous groups who have either settled on or moved through the highveld region of southern Africa. Its roots have been attributed to the Tswana noun tebele meaning a plunderer.

Various groups are known, both currently and in the past, to have used this noun or its derivatives. This includes the Matabele of western Zimbabwe, the South Ndebele of the south and eastern Transvaal, the North Ndebele of the central Transvaal and the Hlubi clan of the Tlokwa, living in the Nqutu district of KwaZulu.
