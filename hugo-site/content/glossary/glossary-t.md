TSONGA. An indigenous group inhabiting the eastern littoral belt of southern Africa from Kosi Bay northwards to Sofala in Mocambique.

The people are more correctly known as the vaTsonga and their language is referred to as siTsonga.

TSWANA. A group indigenous to the interior of southern Africa who are today generally regarded by anthropologists as belonging to a larger Sotho/Tswana identity. Although they originally populated much of the highveld region, the events of the Difaqane forced many of them to move westwards. Today they inhabit Botswana, parts of the western Transvaal, the northern Cape as well as a small enclave in the Thaba 'Nchu district of the Orange Free State. The people are more correctly known as the baTswana and their language is referred to as seTswana.

TSWANA ARCHITECTURE. The Tswana are best known for their use of circular plan, cone on cylinder dwellings surrounded about their full perimeter by a wide verandah. This form is known to have been built in the western Transvaal, northern Cape and eastern Botswana region since the 1600s and probably earlier. Although most such structures today comprise a single living cell, in the past they are known to have reached a high degree of sophistication, including in their plan a number of sleeping and storage areas. Settlement is generally made according to clan affiliations, but the scarcity of water in the region has led to the growth of large urban centres which, in the past, have been estimated to have achieved populations of between 10,000 and 20,000 persons.
