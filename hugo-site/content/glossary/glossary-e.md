**E**

EAVES. The lower horizontal edge of a roof, projecting beyond the face of the wall. (Afrikaans: dakrand).

EDWARDIAN ARCHITECTURE. Although a large measure of overlap may be perceived to have occurred between Victorian Eclecticism and the Edwardian era, the latter period was generally marked by a simplification of building styles and of applied decoration. Sash windows were replaced by casement openings, verandahs became simpler and greater use was made of plaster work, pargeting and mouldings.

"EGG HOUSE". Colloquial term used in parts of Botswana to describe an oval plan rural dwelling.

ENCAUSTIC TILES. Ceramic or glass tiles with a decorative motif fired onto the surface at manufacture. Commonly used in entrance hall and corridor areas, they were imported from Britain. (Afrikaans: brandkleurteel).

ENGLISH SETTLER ARCHITECTURE. A modified English vernacular tradition brought to the eastern Cape region by British settlers after the 1820s. Farm buildings were generally single storied but town houses often reached two floors. Walls were thick and built in stone and the ridged roof, thatched or tiled, was terminated at either end by simple linear parapet gables. In many instances fireplaces were located at either end of the building and the resultant chimney flue projecting through the gable apex gave it its characteristic square capping. Subsequently, when buildings began to be built with only one fireplace, placed either centrally or at one end of the dwelling, the square capped gable was often retained as a stylistic feature.

ERKER. (Afrikaans). See under BAY, BOW or COMPASS WINDOW.

ESCUTCHEON. Plate on a door from the centre of which the handle, or a door knocker is suspended. It also refers to the metal plate which surrounds a key-hole. (Afrikaans: beslagplaat).

EXTENDED HOMESTEAD. A term which embraces the compound homesteads of a number of families who are either closely related to the headman or are otherwise related to one common male ancestor. (Afrikaans: uitgebreide gesineenheid).

EXTRADOS. Outer curved surface of an arch or vault. (Afrikaans: buitewelwing).

EYEBROW DORMER. A window opening in a roof surface but, unlike a dormer, forming no sharp angles with the roof. In southern Africa it is also known as a "leg of mutton" dormer. (Afrikaans: dakoogvenster).
