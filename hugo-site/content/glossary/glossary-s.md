**S**

SABHA MANDAPA. (Indian). An assembly hall in a temple; a mandapa; a ranga mandapa.

SADDLE BARS. The small iron bars reinforcing leaded glazing in casement windows. (Afrikaans: dwarsroeisteun).

SADDLE-PIECE. The junction of a ridge with the main roof cover. See also RIDGE CAPPING. (Afrikaans: nokstuk).

SALA. (Indian). A type of shrine or a miniature version of a shrine that is rectangular in plan and has a barrel-vaulted, or perhaps, more properly, a “barrel-shaped” roof. It may serve as the crowning element of a tower or as a decorative motif repeated on the stories of the superstructure of a south Indian-style temple, as well as in other architectural and decorative contexts. Also an enclosure or cloister.

SAMGHARAMA. (Indian). A monastery.

SAN. Name given by the Khoikhoi to the indigenous group of southern African migrant hunter-gatherers more commonly known as the Bushmen. In view of the pejorative undertones of the latter word, anthropologists and archaeologists have opted, in more recent times, for the former which is believed to signify "a person without domestic stock".

SANDHARA. (Indian). A type of temple characterized by an enclosed passageway for circumambulation.

SAPLING. A thin pliable length of young timber, usually less than 20mm in diameter. (Afrikaans: jong hout).

SASH WINDOW. A window where the opening lights slide up and down in a cased frame, balanced by sash cords passing over a sash pulley. (Afrikaans: skuifraamvenster).

SCISSORS TRUSS. A simple truss formed of four main members. Two are rafters from wall-plate to ridge; the other two extend from the rafter at wall-plate level to the middle of the opposite rafter. These two members intersect at the middle of the span, giving a scissors-like appearance to the truss. (Afrikaans: skerkap).

SCOTIA. A concave moulding, also called a Rising Hollow or a Trochilus. (Afrikaans: trogilus).

SHEARING HOOK. A sickle-shaped cutting tool used by the thatcher for cleaning down the face of finished work. (Afrikaans: sekelgrashaak).

SHIKHARA. (Indian). 1. In north Indian architecture, the spire or tower over the shrine of a temple. 2. In south Indian architecture, the term does not refer to the entire superstructure but only to the globular or domed roof of the uppermost element in the superstructure. It is topped by a finial known as a stupi and is supported by the griva, or neck.

SHINGLE. Wooden roof tile, often made from cleft oak, cedar or teak. (Afrikaans: dakspaan).

SHONA. A group of people indigenous to Zimbabwe, although in the past their lands are thought to have included large areas of the northern Transvaal.

SHORE. Called a shoar; temporary timber buttress used to support buildings undergoing structural maintenance. (Afrikaans: skoor).

SHUTTER. A wooden panel, sometimes louvered, used to fasten externally over a wall opening, either over the window itself or instead of it. (Afrikaans: luik).

supported by lions. Also, the sitting posture of the lion, an asana.

SITIBILE. (isiXhosa). A term used in the Transkei to describe a thatching horse. It may also denote a horse-riding stirrup. It is possible that this word owes its roots to the English "stable", as in "solidly balanced".

SIVA. (Indian). "Auspicious." One of the principal Hindu gods; god of destruction. He may appear in many forms, both peaceful and angry. His characteristic vahana is the bull Nandi; he has many attributes, but one of the most important is the trident. In temples dedicated to him, a linga is usually placed as the central votive object in the shrine rather than an anthropomorphic image of him.

SKARNIER. (Afrikaans). See under HINGE.

SKERKAP. (Afrikaans). See under SCISSORS TRUSS.

SKERM. Dutch term for the wind screens used by early farmers in the Cape. It is probable that these were adapted from similar mat structures used by the indigenous KhoiSan.

SMOOTH STYLE THATCHING. See under BOER STYLE THATCHING. (Afrikaans: boerestyl-grasdak).

SOD BRICK CONSTRUCTION. A method of wall construction used in some parts of southern Africa whereby the building blocks are obtained by cutting up a field of turf into squares approximately 300x450mm. The sods are then lifted up by means of a spade with the clay particles being held together by the vegetation. After the sods have been laid into a vertical wall, the continued growth of the grass is often encouraged in order to bind the individual parts into one larger and homogenous mass. (Afrikaans: sooiblok konstruksie).

SOTHO. A group indigenous to the interior of southern Africa who today are generally regarded by anthropologists as belonging to a larger Sotho/Tswana identity. The current use of this term refers to the southern Sotho of Lesotho and the southern highveld whose national homogeneity is of relatively short standing, being the result of the events of Difaqane and the subsequent colonialisation of the region. Their language is known as seSotho.

SOTHO ARCHITECTURE. The architecture of the southern highveld and Lesotho has undergone extensive changes in recent years. At one time this region was noted for its dwellings with extended, snout-like entrances but since the 1920s these have undergone widespread change and today the thatched cone on cylinder and the lean-to highveld house rival each other for supremacy. The latter dwelling often displays a richly decorated facade.

SOUTH NDEBELE ARCHITECTURE. The South Ndebele inhabit a region of the Transvaal located north-east of Pretoria, between Middelburg and Groblersdal. Historically their architecture has been based upon that of their northern neighbours and political allies, the Pedi. Their dwellings were circular with a verandah running about the external perimeter but in recent years these have largely been superseded by square plan, lean-to, parapet structures, much like those found on the southern highveld. Since the 1940s their women have developed a unique style of polychromatic wall art which draws deeply from the patterns of urban life they have observed in the towns about them.

SPANDREL. A roughly triangular space between the arch of a doorway and the rectangle formed by the outer mouldings surrounding it. (Afrikaans: hoekvlakvormig).

SPAR. A split length of hazel, pointed at both ends and twisted in the middle, using for fixing liggers, cross-rods and scuds. Also known as a spit.

STICK STYLE. A style of domestic timber construction prevalent in the United States during the latter part of the nineteenth century. Its aesthetic is roughly comparable to that of Late Victorian Eclecticism. (Afrikaans: Amerikaanse lat).

STILT DWELLINGS. Although stilt structures have been built in the past by most of southern Africa's rural groups, most have functioned as either grain stores or chicken coops. The only exceptions to this rule were recorded by travellers in the 1830s in the western Transvaal and eastern Botswana region where grass huts were placed upon a stilt platform.

STITCHING NEEDLE. Iron or timber needle used in conjunction with either vegetable fibres, twine or tarred cord to sew the thatch or reed cover onto the timber framework below. (Afrikaans: dekkersnaald).

STOEP. Dutch term used to designate any platform raised above street level such as that fronting the entrance to a house. In more recent times, it has gained popular, if incorrect, usage to denote a verandah.
