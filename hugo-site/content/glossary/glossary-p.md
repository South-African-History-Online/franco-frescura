They are so called because in Sanskrit all the names of these things begin with the letter m. Some lists substitute human sacrifice, the use of the human skull as a drinking vessel, and the singing of lusty songs for some of the practices. Although the five m's are not specifically mentioned as a group in Buddhist texts, the same practices occur in Tantric Buddhism.

When circumambulation is performed with the object of veneration to the right of the devotee, that is to say with the devotee moving in a clockwise direction, the circumambulation is called pradaksina; when the object is to the left and the worshipper moves in a counterclockwise direction, it is called prasavya.

In Western literature, the term is used generically to refer to all circum-ambulatory passageways. However, since the term pradaksina implies only clockwise movement, the name may be inappropriate for some forms of circumambulation which are performed in a counterclockwise (prasavya) direction.

PREFABRICATED BUILDINGS. The concept of prefabricating buildings within a factory environment appears to have begun in Britain during the early years of the nineteenth century when colonial expansion created a ready market for high quality transportable housing. Although these structures were initially in timber, the subsequent introduction of industrialised building elements such as corrugated sheeting and cast iron trims served to enlarge and enrich the range of textures and forms possible under such a system of construction.
