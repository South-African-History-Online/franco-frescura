## About Franco Frescura

Franco Frescura was born in Trieste, Italy in 1946 and emigrated to South Africa in 1956. He became one of the country's foremost experts on indigenous architecture, completing his PhD at the University of the Witwatersrand in 1986. His groundbreaking research documented southern African traditional architecture at a critical moment before much of this knowledge was lost.

Beyond architecture, Franco was a political activist, satirical cartoonist, and dedicated academic who fought against apartheid through his art and scholarship.
