##### COLONIAL POST AND TELEGRAPH DIARY OF THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE  
Taken from official sources and archival records

1501, July 7: In 1497 Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama anchored in Mossel Bay and named it the “Bay of Herdsmen”. Four years later another Portuguese navigator, Joao da Nova, put into the bay and found that a message had been left for him, in an old shoe which had been left hanging from a tree, a White Milkwood, growing near the water springs. The letter was from Pedro d’Ataide, a captain in the fleet of Pedro Alvares Cabral, who had passed this way on 5 March 1501. Although this method of communication was never adopted, the tree has subsequently become known in local mythology as the “Post Office Tree”.

1527\. The custom of leaving a flat rock upon the shore of Table Bay, inscribed with the names of the ship, its captain, and the dates of their visit, appears to have begun as early as 1527, when a French vessel left in Table Bay a slab of rock inscribed “Ity est arrive david digaed de Dieppe 8 10th de Fevrer 1”. Although they have subsequently become known as Post Office Stones, their primary function was to provide a record of the visit, and only some of them were used as postal markers 1591\. The practice of leaving a packet of letters beneath an inscribed stone appears to have been well established by 1591, when Admiral George Raymond, accompanied by Captain James Lancaster, reached Table Bay and there, we are told, left behind flat stones inscribed with the names of their ship and its captain, and the dates of their arrival and departure. 

1601, September 9: The British vessels “Dragon”, “Ascension”, “Gift” and “Susan”, homeward bound from Batavia, anchored in Table Bay. Hippon, Master of the “Susan”, left behind a batch of letters beneath a flat stone with the following inscription: “ANTO HIPON MA OF THE HECTOR BOVN HOME JANVARI 1600”.

1607, July 16: The British sailing vessel “Consent”, outward bound for Batavia, anchored in Table Bay, and, during her stay, her crew left behind a batch of letters beneath a Post Office Stone.

1607, December 17: The British vessels “Dragon” and “Hector”, homeward bound from Batavia, anchored in Table Bay. Hippon, now Master of the “Dragon”, left behind a batch of letters beneath the same Post Office Stone he had used some six years earlier. This time he added the following inscription to it: “ANT HIPON MA OF THE DRAGON 28 DECEMBER 1607”.

1610\. Sir Henry Middleton, captain of the “Trade’s Increase”, landed in Table Bay and found a letter buried in the ground. Unfortunately it was so damaged by moisture as to be illegible.

1613, February 20. The British vessel “Dragon”, homeward bound from Batavia, anchored in Table Bay and left behind a batch of letters beneath a Post Office Stone. On 28 June 1614 they were discovered by William Edwards, who made a report to this effect to his directors in London.

1613, October. A group of English merchants traveling to the Indies, arrived at Table Bay only to discover that their visit coincided with that of a Dutch ship. During the course of the subsequent interchange between the two groups, the Dutch handed them a packet of letters they had discovered on top of a nearby hill. Upon reading, these were found to originate from a previous English expedition headed by a Captain Downston. The packet was resealed and returned to its place beneath the stone slab.

1617, January 2: The British vessels “Dragon” and “Expedition”, homeward bound from Batavia, anchored in Table Bay and, during their stay, left behind a batch of letters beneath a Post Office Stone. The slab, which had been especially brought out from England for this purpose, was approximately 120cm high, 75cm wide and 15cm deep, and was engraved with the British coat of arms.

1617, February 10: The Dutch sailing ships “Amsterdam” and “Groot Sonne”, homeward bound, anchored in Table Bay, and during their stay left behind a batch of letters beneath a Post Office Stone.

1618, June 20: The British vessels “Dragon” and “Lion”, outward bound, anchored in Table Bay, and upon their departure, they left behind a batch of letters beneath a Post Office Stone inscribed as follows: “NNO 1618 JO WDAL MAS O LN ARID THE 23 O DEPD FOR SVRRAT TH JVNE & DANIE WRHT GEORE PIKE MARCTS ISAC SEVENSON MR MATE ARV JVN E Ye O 3 I LYON 1620”.

1619, May 15: The British vessel “Anne”, homeward bound, anchored in Table Bay, and during her stay her crew left behind a batch of letters beneath a Post Office Stone.

1619, November 29: The British vessel “Bull”, outward bound, anchored in Table Bay, and during her stay her crew left behind a batch of letters beneath a Post Office Stone inscribed as follows: “RO ADAMS COM OF THE BVL ARIVED 29 OF NOVEM & DEP THE 12 OF DE 1619 FOR BANTAM JO COCKRAM CAPE MARCH LETTERS VNDER”.

1620, January 20: The British vessel “Rose”, outward bound, anchored in Table Bay, and during her stay her crew left behind a batch of letters beneath a Post Office Stone.

1620, February 2: The Dutch vessel “Goude Leeuw”, outward bound, anchored in Table Bay, and during her stay her crew left behind a batch of letters beneath a Post Office Stone.

1620, June 24: The British vessels “Roebuck”, “London”, “Hart” and “Eagle”, outward bound, anchored in Table Bay, and during their stay left behind a batch of letters beneath a Post Office Stone. The “Roebuck”, “London” and “Hart” returned on 1 February 1822 and probably left another stone.

1622, December 8: The British vessel “Lesser James”, homeward bound from Batavia, anchored in Table Bay and, upon her departure, her crew left behind a batch of letters beneath a Post Office Stone inscribed as follows: “JOHN ROBERTS COMMAVNDER OF THE LESSER JAMES AR Y 8 DECEM DE Y 26 1622 LOVK WITH THIS LINE FOR LETERES”. This stone was added to a few days later by the crew of the “Abegail”, a British vessel outward bound, which anchored in Table Bay on 17 December 1622. Their inscription reads as follows: “HENRY MANCHES JAMES BVRGES M OF THE ABIGALL AR Y 17 DEPAR Y 26 OF DECEMBAR 1622”. The same stone was reused in 1627 by the crew of the “Hart”.

1623, March 10: The British vessel “London”, homeward bound from Surat, anchored in Table Bay on 10 March 1623. During her stay her crew left behind a Post Office Stone with the following inscription: “THE LONDON ARIVED THE 10 OF M HERE FROM SVRAT BOND FOR ENGLAND AND DEPAR THE 20 DICTO RICHARD BLYTH CAPTAINE 1622 HEARE VNDER LOOKE FOR LETTERS”. In 1629 the same stone was reused by Dutch sailors. It was discovered on 17 August 1827, during the course of repairs to a sewer on the Heerengracht, but for some reason it was reburied, and was only brought to light again in 1897.

1623, March 19: The Danish vessel “Christianshaven”, outward bound, anchored in Table Bay and, during her stay, her crew buried a wooden casket containing the ship’s letters. They then marked the position with a wooden post giving the name of the ship. 

1623, May 29: The British vessel “Hart”, outward bound, anchored in Table Bay and, during her stay, her crew left behind a batch of letters beneath a Post Office Stone.  
1624, July 28: The British vessels “Royal James”, “Jonas”, “Star”, “Spy” and “Scout”, outward bound, anchored in Table Bay and, during their stay, left behind a batch of letters beneath a Post Office Stone.

1625\. The British vessel “Star” anchored in Table Bay and, during its stay, the ship’s surgeon, Edward Wilson, left behind a batch of letters beneath a Post Office Stone inscribed “Edwa.Wilson ship - Star 1625”.

1627, July 7: The British vessel “Hart”, homeward bound, anchored in Table Bay and, during her stay, her crew left behind a batch of letters, reusing the Post Office Stone originally engraved by the crew of the “Lesser James” on 8 December, and by the crew of the “Abegail” on 17 December 1622. Their inscription, which is largely illegible, reads partly as follows: “M R ARIVED LY DEPARTED DIT FOR SARAT 27”.  
1628, May 29: The British vessel “William”, homeward bound, anchored in Table Bay and, during her stay, her crew left behind a batch of letters beneath a Post Office Stone.

1629, September 3: The British vessel “Hopewell”, homeward bound, anchored in Table Bay and, during her stay, her crew left behind a batch of letters beneath a Post Office Stone.

1631: The Khoikhoi chief Autshumato, known subsequently to foreign visitors variously as Hadah, Hada, Adda, Haddot and, after 1652, as Harry, was befriended by the British and taken by them to the Javanese port of Bantam. During the journey he gained a broad knowledge of English, and after his return to the Cape early in 1632, he and some thirty of his followers were transported, at their own request, to Robben Island. There he was employed by the British as an agent, liaising on their behalf with other Khoi groups on the mainland, and keeping mail in his possession until collected by the next ship. Consequently he must be regarded to be South Africa’s first resident postmaster. By 1638 records indicate that a second Khoikhoi, known as Isaac, had also learnt to speak English, and that sometime later he was taken by the Dutch to Batavia. He was returned to the bay in 1642, the Dutch no doubt intending to employ him as their own agent. He probably died in 1646. Autshumato and his people left Robben Island sometime in the early 1640s, and after 1652 he was installed by the Dutch as their chief translator. However on 19 October 1853, while the Dutch were attending church, Autshumato absconded with most of their cattle. Eventually the herd was captured by a rival Khoikhoi group, the Goringhaiqua, and in June 1655 Autshumato returned to the Dutch, managing to persuade them that the theft had been perpetuated by the Goringhaiqua, who now held the cattle. The Dutch believed him and reinstated him as their chief translator. Autshumato then proceeded to amass a large herd of cattle and sheep, largely at the expense of his employers. As a result, in June 1658, he was arrested and banished to Robben Island, while his herds were confiscated. In December 1659 he managed to return back to the mainland, escaping in a leaky rowboat, and went into exile among his own people, where he died in 1663.

1631, May 29: The British vessels “Palsgrave” and “London”, outward bound, anchored in Table Bay and, during their stay, left behind a batch of letters beneath a Post Office Stone.

1631, July 13: The British vessel “Discovery”, homeward bound, anchored in Table Bay and, during her stay, her crew left behind a batch of letters beneath a Post Office Stone.

1632, cJanuary: Captain Weddell, probably of the British vessel “Charles”, anchored in Table Bay and, upon his departure, left behind on Robben Island a batch of letters in the keeping of the Khoikhoi chief Autshumato.

1632, April 3: The earliest recorded Post Office Stone inscribed in Dutch was left behind when the Dutch sailing ships “Nassau”, “Nimmegen”, “Wesel” and “Galyas”, homeward bound from Batavia, anchored in Table Bay. It bore the following inscription: “HIER ONDER LEGGEN BRIEVEN VAND COMAND DV LEE EN VICE COMD P.CROOCK MET DE SCHEPEN NASSAU FRE HENDRIK NIMMEGEN WESEL EN DE GALIAS. ALHIER DEN 9 APRIL 1632 VAN BATTAVIA GEARIVEERT VIR OCKEN DEN 15 DITTO”. 

1632, May 15: British seamen from the vessel “Pearl” landed in Table Bay where they were met by the Khoikhoi chief Autshumato. He delivered to them a batch of letters which had been left in his safekeeping by the crew of the “London” some time previously.

1632, November 12: The British vessel “Blessing”, homeward bound, anchored in Table Bay and, during her stay, her crew collected the mail which had been left by the “Charles” on Robben Island in the keeping of the Khoikhoi chief Autshumato, in about January 1632.

1634, April 7: The Dutch vessels “Wassenaer”, “Banda” and “Egmont”, outward bound, anchored in Table Bay and, during their stay, they left behind a batch of letters beneath a Post Office Stone inscribed as follows: “BANDA WASSENAER END EGMONT SYN DEN XI APRIL VERTROCKE SOECKT BRIEF”.

1634, May 13: The British vessel “Mary”, homeward bound, anchored in Table Bay and, upon her departure, her crew left behind on Robben Island a batch of letters in the keeping of the Khoikhoi chief Autshumato.

1634, June 4: The British vessel “Coaster”, outward bound, anchored in Table Bay and during her stay her crew collected two batches of mail which had previously been left on Robben Island, in the keeping of the Khoikhoi chief Autshumato.

1635, April: The British vessel “Jonas”, homeward bound, anchored in Table Bay and, upon her departure, her crew left behind a batch of letters beneath a Post Office Stone.

1638, February 18: Dutch vessels including, among others, the “Wezel”, “Haarlem”, “Middelburg” and “Nassau”, outward bound, anchored in Table Bay. Upon their arrival they collected mail which had previously been left behind on Robben Island, in the keeping of the Khoikhoi chief Autshumato. Having found him to be reliable, upon their departure they left their mail with him. This was collected on 18 March by the “Amsterdam”. However they also marked their visit with an engraved stone, which they left on the mainland. 

1639, May 6: The British vessel “Mary”, homeward bound, anchored in Table Bay and her crew collected mail which had previously been left behind on Robben Island in the keeping of the Khoikhoi chief Autshumato.

1646, February 27: Dutch vessels, including, among others, the “Tiger”, “Walvisch”, “Vrede” and “Zutphen”, homeward bound, anchored in Table Bay. Upon their arrival the Chief Mate of the “Zutphen” was sent ashore to collect the “Dutch” mail from Isaac. This Isaac refused to hand over until the next day, when he could make the delivery in person to the Captain of the “Zutphen” aboard his ship. Upon their departure the Dutch left a consignment of letters with Isaac.

1693: Governor Simon van der Stel establishes the position of Veldwachtmeesters, or “field watch officers”. These persons fell under the jurisdiction of local magistrates, or Landdrosts, and were expected to act as subordinate magistrates, with authority over a sub-division of the magisterial district. They also acted as an important communication link between the Colonial administration in Cape Town and the outlying districts, and their duties included the transmission of government notices, dispatches and official letters. In time they also came to include the collection and delivery of private mails. By the time of the first British occupation of the Cape in 1795, these officials had become known as Field-Cornets.

1788: The Cape’s Council of Policy was instructed by the Directors of the Dutch East India Company (VoC) in Holland to investigate the possibility of establishing a postal service linking the colony to the Cape. 

1789, December 28: The Council of Policy, under Governor Cornelis Jacob van de Graaff, resolved establish a post comptoir for the Cape.

1792, March 2: Adriaan Vincent Bergh was appointed the Cape’s first official postmaster under Acting Governor Johan Isaac Rhenius. His office was located in the Leerdam Bastion of Cape Town Castle. Each letter arriving at the Cape had to be paid for upon collection.

1803, June 13: A monthly mail service, connecting Cape Town to Algoa Bay, was established.

1803, June 24: The Dragoon Postal Service, connecting Cape Town to Simonstown daily, was established. This was a military service which operated primarily in the winter months, when ships of the VoC anchored in the safer waters of False Bay.

1803, November 2: A weekly postal route, connecting Cape Town to Stellenbosch, was established. At first mail was carried by relays of Khoikhoi runners, but these were eventually replaced by post wagons.

1806, January 10: The Dutch garrison at the Cape surrenders to a British expeditionary force, and the colony moves permanently into British control.

1806, April 1: First official mail service linking Cape Town to Simonstown established. Mail was carried thrice weekly by relays of Khoikhoi runners. Payment for postage could only be made in Cape Town, and consequently letters from outlying districts could only be paid for upon collection.

1806, May 3: Cape Town businessman, William Caldwell, was appointed Deputy Postmaster General, pending the arrival of a new Postmaster General from England. Caldwell was charged with the revision of postal charges, as well as the reorganization of the local postal system. Particular attention was to be paid to the conveyance of mails to Saldanha Bay, Stellenbosch, Tulbagh, Swellendam, Mossel Bay, Plettenberg Bay, Uitenhage and Graff-Reinet.

1806, May 23: The post office in Cape Town is re-opened for business in the Castle under the management of a postal clerk, JH Berrange.

1807, July 10: Horse Posts, better known as "Post Orderlies", replaced runners on inland mails.

1807, October 13: The use of Official-Free postage limited to a specific group of government officials. Surprisingly the Postmaster General was omitted from this list, and was only accorded this privilege after 8 February 1817.

1807, December 3: Matthew Gall arrives from England, and is immediately appointed Postmaster General of the Cape, replacing Caldwell who returns to private business.  
1809, May 20: Robert Crozier replaced Matthew Gall as Postmaster General. Gall, who had proved himself thoroughly inept, returned to England. Initially Crozier was only designated as “PMG, Acting for Mr Gall”, but was formally confirmed to this position on 18 November 1815.

1809, October 2: The General Post Office was moved from its original quarters in the Castle to new premises in the Old Slave Quarters. On 16 August 1816 it was moved to new and more convenient rooms in the same building.

1810: A basic fee of 4d had to be paid on every letter arriving from overseas. The ship’s Master received a 1d fee for every letter he carried.

1815, November 15: Robert Crozier formally confirmed as Postmaster General.  
1822, February 1: First post office opened in Port Elizabeth, with William Dunn as its first postmaster.

1846: Postal rates were standardised at 4d per half ounce. The frequency of mail deliveries from Cape Town to Grahamstown was increased to twice per week.

1846: A line of military semaphores was built connecting Grahamstown to Fort Beaufort. Unfortunately the atmospheric conditions prevailing in the region made visual communication virtually impossible except on cool, dry days, when visibility was not affected by either an early morning mist or heavy atmospheric refraction of the air. By the early 1850s the system had fallen into disuse.

1846: The so-called “Coolie Hire Service” comes into operation in Cape Town. Although it was in blatant contravention of the Post Office’s official monopoly on the portage of mail, it was allowed to operate subject to regulations imposed by the Cape Town Municipality, which placed limitations upon the weight which “coolie postmen” were allowed to carry. The service was provided by self-employed Malay carriers who, in return for a fixed fee, were allowed to convey letters and parcels within the immediate vicinity of Cape Town. The service ceased to operate in 1855.

1846, March 1: The GPO begins to conduct Money Order transactions.

1851: Johannes Adriaan le Sueur appointed Postmaster General of the Cape.

1851, January 27: The first Ocean Mail contract, for carrying mail between England and the Cape, was awarded to the General Screw Steam Shipping Company. The service was inaugurated by the Bosphorus, which arrived in Cape Town on 27 January 1851 on the outward leg of the first journey. However, by 1855, the company had run into financial difficulties, and in 1856 the contract was awarded to a British Member of Parliament, WS Lindsay. Unfortunately his ships proved to be too slow, making the voyage in over 50 days instead of the stipulated 36. As a result in about August 1857 the contract was again put out to tender, and this time it was awarded to Union Steamship Co (Ltd).

1852: Mail deliveries from Cape Town to Grahamstown were increased to three times per week. A Book Post was established between the Cape and the United Kingdom.

1853: After prolonged complaints, the Clerks of Civil Commissioners and Resident Magistrates were relieved of their duties as postmasters. However this system was to remain in place in Basutoland and the Native Territories until as late as the 1880s.

1853, September 1: The prepayment of postage by means of postal adhesives, or stamps, was introduced in the Cape. The stamps were designed by Charles Bell, Surveyor General of the Cape, and depicted “Hope” reclining within a triangular format. They were engraved and recess printed by the British security firm of Perkins Bacon, and were issued in imperforate sheets. However the prepayment of postage in coin remained optional.

1854: Book Post services to the UK extended to Mossel Bay and Port Elizabeth.

1854, January: The Registered Mail service was instituted on a formal basis. The practice of recording the dispatch of a letter in an official book probably began under the Dutch in 1792, but in the event of loss, no liability accrued to the Post Office.

1854, January 23: Private Boxes, later known as Post Boxes, were first introduced at the Cape Town Post Office.

1856: The postal rate to the United Kingdom was fixed at 6d per half ounce.

1857: Publications printed in the Colony, not exceeding 6oz in mass, permitted to be forwarded through the post at 1d per ounce.

1857, October 29: In about August 1857 the new Ocean Mail contract was awarded to the Union Castle Line. The service was inaugurated by the Dane, which arrived at Cape Town on 29 October 1857 on the outward leg of the first monthly sailing.

1858: The prepayment of inland letters by means of postage stamps was made compulsory.

1858: Issue of the first Post Office Guide Hand Book, published by Saul Solomon & Co, Cape Town.

1860, September 15: Provisions for a local Penny Post were promulgated on 12 February 1846, but were only implemented some fourteen years later, when the first Penny Post was established in Cape Town. The subsequent year this was extended to Port Elizabeth, and by 1877 the reduced tariff had been extended to most of the Colony’s major centers of population.

1860, April: The first telegraph line to be erected in the Cape, running between Cape Town and Simon's Town, was opened.

1861: Building of telegraph line joining East London to King William’s Town.

1861, February 23: Early in 1861 supplies of postal adhesives began to run out, and although new supplies had been ordered from the British printers, Perkins Bacon, some time before, it became obvious that these would not reach the Cape in time to meet local needs. Consequently the postal authorities in Cape Town authorized the firm of Saul Solomon & Co to print a stock of stamps. The plates were engraved locally by CJ Roberts, and although he based his design upon the triangular stamps in current use, he was unable to match their fine line and elegant detail. The final result had a coarse, wood-cut appearance, and consequently they became known as the "woodblock" issue. Between 23 February and 10 April 1861 a total of 125, 102 stamps of the 1d value, and 113,256 of the 4d value were printed, before it was realized that a consignment of stamps from Perkins Bacon had been delivered to the Colony some time before, and that, through a bureaucratic blunder, had been languishing all along in a Cape Town customs warehouse awaiting clearance.

1862: Authorisation given for the building of a telegraph line joining Cape Town to Grahamstown. The first leg of this line, from Grahamstown to Port Elizabeth, was inaugurated on 2 January 1862, and work over the whole line was completed in 1864.  
1862: The transfer of money from one centre to the next through the medium of the Post Office, known as Money Orders, was instituted in 1862. Initially this was set at ₤10, but in May 1905 this was raised to a maximum sum of ₤40.

1862, October: Inland Book Post services extended to all centers served by a mail cart.

1863: The first Cape railway line, from Cape Town to Wellington, was opened. This was subsequently purchased by the Cape Government in 1873.

1863, March: A new Ocean Mail contract for the transport of mails between England and the Cape was awarded to the Union Castle Line. A competing tender was submitted by the Diamond Line Shipping Co, and although its offer was lower than that of the Union Line, it was rejected because its fleet had yet to be built. In terms of the new contract, which was to run for seven years, the mail-ship company also had to extend its sailings to Port Elizabeth, and the first Union mail steamer entered Algoa Bay on 22 February 1864. The Diamond Line was undeterred by its failure to gain the official mail contract, and once its flagship, the Eastern Province was put into service, it began to provide a cheaper and faster “private” service than the Union Line. However the company was not able to maintain its early momentum, and it ceased its operations in 1867.

1864: The Penny Post was extended to all places in the Colony served twice daily by a mail.

1864: A mail service between the Cape Colony and Mauritius, with connections to Suez and Europe, was inaugurated. This became known as the “Overland Mail”.

1864, January: Issue of first “Hope Seated” rectangular stamp series.

1866: A Pattern and Sample Post was established between the Cape and the United Kingdom. In 1869 this was extended to the interior of the Colony.

1865: The Postmaster General of the Cape, Johannes Adriaan le Sueur, was suspended from office following the embezzlement of some ₤1800 from the Post Office by one of his subordinates. Although no charges of dishonesty were ever brought against Le Sueur, the subsequent Commission of Enquiry into the matter found that, as the officer in charge, he was personally responsible for the shortfall incurred, and ordered that he repay it in full. He was formally dismissed from the Post Office in 1867, but following a prolonged campaign to clear his name, Le Sueur was quietly acquitted of all charges by the Cape Legislature, and eventually all his pension rights were reinstated. The repayment of the ₤1800 was initially halved, and then waived in its entirety. During his term of suspension the duties of PMG were filled by James Davidson, as Acting PMG.

1867, October 1: Charles Piers was appointed Postmaster General of the Cape. Piers was an accountant with no prior Post Office experience, and was obviously brought in by the Cape Government to revise Post Office fiscal procedures and introduce new safeguards in the aftermath of the scandal which terminated Le Sueur’s career as an administrator. In 1873 Piers returned to his former duties in the Treasury.

1868, November 17: Issue of current stocks of “Hope Seated” 6d stamps overprinted in red with "FOUR PENCE" for provisional usage.

1869: The fee for the Registration of letters was reduced from 6d to 4d.

1870, October 15: The first mails were dispatched from the Griqualand Diamond Fields. At this stage they were forwarded to Cape Town via the Orange Free State.

1871, January 19: The first mails were dispatched from Cape Town to the Griqualand Diamond Fields. The receiving post office was located at Klip Drift, subsequently renamed Barkly West, which was opened on the same day. Initially the territory used postal adhesives from the Cape Colony, but from 1877 to 1880 it made use of Cape stamps overprinted with the letters “GW” and “G” in a variety of sizes and typefaces. In October 1880 Griqualand West was incorporated into the Cape, and its post offices returned to using the Colony’s postal adhesives.

1871, August 25: Issue of the second “Hope Seated” rectangular stamp series.

1872: The Cape Goverment began the construction of railways under the control of the Public Works Department.

1872, February 1: The first post office in Basutoland was opened at Maseru.

1873: The General Post Office was moved from its premises in the Old Slave Quarters in Bureau Street, which it had occupied for 64 years, to a building on the corner of Church and St George’s Streets, which was leased for this purpose from Saul Solomon. When this building was subsequently vacated by the Post Office in 1897, it was taken over by the Cape Times.

1873: George Aitchison was appointed Postmaster General of the Cape. He joined the Post Office on 23 September 1850 as an Additional Clerk at the GPO in Cape Town, and after a steady rise through the ranks, was appointed Accountant and Secretary to the PMG in 1860, effectively becoming Le Sueur’s deputy. Despite his high position and close association with Le Sueur, he appears to have survived the financial scandal of 1865 with his reputation relatively untarnished. For a time he dropped out of sight in Tulbagh, where he served as Civil Commissioner and Resident Magistrate from 1 January 1869 through to 1873, but in that year he was recalled to the Post Office where he served as PMG until he died in office on 26 January 1892.

1873, July 1: The Cape of Good Hope Telegraph Company was purchased by the Cape Government for a sum of ₤41,124. At the time it included 760 miles of telegraph lines and 16 telegraph offices.

1874, September 1: Issue of current stocks of “Hope Seated” 6d stamps overprinted in red with "ONE PENNY" for provisional usage. In Kimberley the postmaster amended a stock of 4d stamps by inscribing them “1d” by hand in red-brown ink.

1875: The Cape Railways were separated into three branches, the Western, Midland and Eastern Systems.

1875, March 1: The telegraph rate was reduced to 5 shillings for twenty words from Cape Town to Port Elizabeth, and to 8 shillings for the same to East London.

1876: The Kimberley Diamond Fields were linked to the Cape's telegraphic network.

1876: A Returned Letter Office was established in Cape Town’s GPO.

1876, June: The Ocean Mail contract, which the Union Line had held for nearly 20 years, expired, and when the results of the new tender were announced, the new contract was awarded jointly to the Union Line and the Donald Currie Line, better known as the Castle Line. Sailings were increased to three times per month, with the two companies making alternate trips.

1876, October 1: The Cape Colony assumed responsibility for providing the Ocean Mail Service. Under the new contract a regular weekly service was inaugurated linking the Cape to the United Kingdom in 26 days.

1876, November: Issue of current stocks of “Hope Seated” 1s stamps overprinted in black with "ONE PENNY" for provisional usage.

1877: Postal cards introduced, but their use was permitted only in those areas where a penny postal service was in operation.

1877, March: Griqualand West overprints postal adhesives of the Cape Colony with the letters “GW” and “G” in a variety of sizes and typefaces. After Griqualand West was incorporated into the Cape in October 1880, stocks of these stamps were transferred from Kimberley to Cape Town, and were distributed to post offices in the Cape Colony for normal use.
