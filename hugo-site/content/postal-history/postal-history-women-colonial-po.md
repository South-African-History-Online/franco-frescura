#####   
WOMEN IN THE CAPE COLONIAL POST OFFICE

Franco Frescura

##### INTRODUCTION

It is probably safe to assume that the Cape Post Office was a product of its time, and that it was neither more nor less discriminatory of women than the greater part of the society it served. Throughout its 118-year colonial history, its senior management staff remained exclusively male, and although it is not known at what stage women began to work at the GPO in Cape Town, it seems likely that, until 1910 their numbers remained relatively low. Sir Somerset French, Cape Postmaster General from 1892 to 1908, did not oppose the employment of women but, as a matter of policy, would not countenance it where they were forced to share the same office space as male employees. This might explain the creation of a Women’s Branch at the GPO, although the exact location of its premises, the nature of its duties, and what protocols it followed in its dealings with male colleagues are not known.

##### EARLY YEARS

Women began to be appointed to the Cape Post Office as early as 1808, when Catharina Hendrina Caldwell, nee Bletterman, wife of Deputy Postmaster General, William Caldwell, was appointed postmaster of Stellenbosch. She had married Caldwell on 12 February 1796, less than a month after his arrival at the Cape and, not only did she bear him two daughters, but also appears to have taken an active hand in her husband's business affairs. For the next twenty years, the Caldwells led a busy, and even convoluted, business life, running in rapid sequence a warehouse, a hotel, a retail store and a boarding house, another boarding house, a general merchandise store and an agency for a London property firm. Catharina, who must have been a vigorous and enterprising woman, was appointed postmaster at Stellenbosch on 8 May 1808, with Mrs AC Hudson as her deputy. She filled this post for the next 38 years, with only a brief break in 1829, and retired from the Post Office in 1846, when she must have been close to 70 years old. Although Caldwell died in Cape Town on 2 July 1816, at the age of 58, his wife continued to provide lodgings at their old house at 7 Bergh Street, as well as at 30 Strand Street, while also retaining her position as postmaster at Stellenbosch,

Mary Biggar was born in England in about 1781 and married Capt Alexander Biggar in about 1800. Over the next twenty years she bore him eleven children, the last of whom was born aboard the Weymouth en route to the Cape, which they reached on 15 May 1820. After the death of her husband in Zululand in 1839 she settled in Port Elizabeth where she was appointed postmaster on 17 December 1840, a position she held until her retirement in 1852. She died in Grahamstown on 9 February 1855, at the age of 74. Her grandson, John Dunn, subsequently gained dubious fame in Zululand as a trader, a hunter, and finally as the betrayer of his benefactor, King Chetshwayo. Unlike many other postmasters of her time, Mary Biggar had no other commercial interests, and during her tenure, used her home in Chapel Lane as the town’s post office. Although she did move once, on 2 July 1845, this was to another house, only a few doors down the street.

##### CONSOLIDATION AND DEVELOPMENT

When the English took over the colonial administration of the Cape in 1806, their settlement initially tended to follow the patterns of expansion previously established by the Dutch, focusing primarily upon the more fertile western and southern Cape, with a limited and highly scattered population of migrant herders in the arid interior. This region had originally been inhabited by clans of Khoikhoi migrant pastoralists and hunter-gatherers who, by the 1750s, had been largely decimated by disease, famine and a deliberate policy of genocide by the Dutch. Thus, although it was not as fertile as the Eastern Cape, life in the Karoo was not as perilous as it was on the eastern frontier, and the area was not subject to conflicting land claims.

By 1806 the region was largely inhabited by scattered families of Dutch herders, who had by now supplanted the indigenous Khoi, and by 1840 only four major villages had been established in the Karoo, at Graaff-Reinet (founded in 1786), Cradock (1816), Beaufort West (1820) and Colesberg (1830). In 1836 the northward migration of some 20,000 dissident Dutch from the colony, created a vacuum that the British were not slow to fill, particularly once the advantages of its climate became known among those suffering from consumption. As a result the region became the focus of more systematic agricultural activity, and over the next forty years, some 41 major villages were established, 18 of these in the 1870-80 period. In the colonial nomenclature of the time, most of these were described as “towns”, although it was plainly absurd to give this title to a place having little more than one thousand inhabitants. By 1875 the Census had shown that Graaff-Reinet, the largest of these settlements, had 4562 residents, Cradock had 1712, Beaufort West had 1585, and Colesberg had 1312. In general only about 40% of this population could be considered to be literate and numerate.

It follows therefore that, outside the major centers of urban habitat, the Post Office could draw its staff from only a limited pool of skills and labour. Given these constraints, and despite its prevailing patriarchal corporate culture, the Colonial Post Office had to accept the entry of women into its ranks, and in time came to offer career prospects to young women which neither business, nor other branches of the civil service, could match. Provided a woman was not averse to the relatively slow pace of life in a small town or village, the Post Office could provide its female postmasters with relative independence of action, high social status in the community, a salary comparable to that of their male counterparts, experience in the management and running of a small business, and security of tenure. In a society where women were subjected to a high degree of social constraint, the Post Office offered their female employees the opportunity of frequent travel and movement between one posting and the next.

Judging by the Civil Establishment Blue Books, there were a number of women who chose to lead an adventurous and less sedentary life. Miss A Krynauw, for example, moved no less than eight times in ten years, starting off at Doorn River in 1898, moving on to Riebeek Kasteel in 1899, Schoemanshoek and Zuurbraak in 1903, River Zonder End and Gordon's Bay in 1905, and Schoemanshoek in 1908. Her sister, not wishing to be outdone, served at seven post offices in five years. A similar career was followed by Mrs MA Keys, who between 1887, when she first entered postal employment, until 1903, when she finally moved to East London, served as postmaster at eight post offices. Miss MM Brown joined the Post Office in 1885 when she was appointed the postmaster at Douglas, she then served at sixteen other establishments located in the Karoo, in the northern and in the western Cape, before finally moving to Libodi, in the Transkei, in 1907. Misses KS Burke, Leonora Marchiano, M O’Kennedy, Johanna Walton and M Grobbelaar all led similar, well-travelled and presumably adventurous lives.

##### SOME PERSONALITIES OF NOTE

Between 1792 and 1910 the Cape Post Office employed some 3600 persons in the capacity of postmaster. Of these less than 10% were women. Their number, therefore, was not statistically high. However, given the fact that many of the smaller country post offices were associated with family businesses, and that many assistant postmasters and postal clerks were women, it stands to reason that they played a far greater role in the affairs of the Colonial Post Office than the figures would lead us to believe. Because of the nature of a colonial frontier society, many of these would have been intelligent, enterprising and highly motivated, and it should be no surprise, therefore, that a number of the postal workers who performed noteworthy service during the South African War of 1899-1902 were women. 

Miss Patience A Burke, for example, acted as postmaster at Garies from 1 April 1892 through to 1 April 1903. On 12 September 1901 Republican forces entered the village and ransacked its post office, inflicting extensive damage upon its establishment. Despite the presence of Republican soldiers in her office, she had the presence of mind to save some of her mails, although the remainder of the post, as well as some stores, were set alight and destroyed. Thereafter she was detained as a prisoner in her quarters under armed guard.

Mrs Sarah Glueck began her career in the Post Office as a postal assistant at Lady Grey, in the division of Aliwal North, in 1897, and by 1899 had been promoted to the position of its postmaster. On 14 November 1899, at the outset of the South African War, a small group of irregular Republican troops from the OFS, together with some local sympathizers, attempted to affix a Proclamation of Annexation to the Lady Grey post office notice board, and demanded its keys from its postmaster. Mrs Glueck not only refused to oblige, but replaced the proclamation with a notice of her own, reminding Cape citizens of their loyalty to the British Crown. On 19th November the Republican forces returned in greater numbers, and despite her vigorous protestations, they took over her offices. Following their withdrawal from the village in March 1900 the postal and communication infrastructure of the north-eastern districts of the Cape was only re-established with difficulty. Owing to a shortage of qualified personnel in this region the postmaster at Herschel was delegated to travel with the military to Barkly East to re-open its telegraph office. In his absence, his work was undertaken by Mrs Glueck and, for a time, she travelled the distance between Lady Grey and Barkly East on horseback on a daily basis, and served the postal and telegraphic needs of both communities. Her efforts did not go unnoticed, and in his report to Parliament for 1899 the Postmaster General singled her out for her work and made special mention of the manner in which she safeguarded official property during the course of the Republican invasion. Most importantly, the actions of Sarah Glueck at the start of the war seized the imagination of the public, and once the story reached the British press, her courage was given international coverage: poems were written about her, and pictures of her were sold in their thousands throughout the Empire.

Miss Johanna C Walton, appears to have been a person of similar temperament. When the South African War broke out in October 1899, she was the postmaster at Van Wyk's Vlei, a small village in the heart of the Carnarvon district, in the northern Cape. Despite its isolated locality, Republican forces appear to have conceived an irrational antipathy towards this post office, and during the course of the South African War they sacked it on three separate occasions. On 13 March 1900 a group of about 20 Republican sympathizers entered the village and demanded that Miss Walton, hand over the keys to her establishment. Much to their surprise, she not only refused to do so, but also stood her ground, taunting them with the words "Shoot, coward, and kill me". Despite her bold action, she was forcibly removed from the premises, and her telegraph equipment was stolen. On 12 February 1901 Republican troops, probably under Gen Barry Hertzog, entered Van Wyk's Vlei and ransacked her post office, inflicting extensive damage upon its premises. On 28 August 1901 Dutch commandos looted the post office for a third time and, obviously tiring of this repetitious ritual, for good measure they also burnt it down together with the village's public offices. In her efforts to safeguard government property, Miss Walton once again put up a courageous resistance to the Dutch, but she was ultimately forced to abandon her post when fire began to engulf her premises. Obviously mindful of the courage she had shown under fire, after the war the Cape Post Office seconded Walton to a series of more convenient postings closer to Cape Town, where she continued to work until her retirement on pension in 1908.

Another person of note was Mrs Scott, the daughter of Robert Hart of Glen Avon, England, and a wealthy widow in her own right. She emigrated to South Africa in about 1862, probably as a volunteer worker for the London Missionary Society, and soon thereafter joined the Rev Richard Birt at his mission station at Peelton, near King William's Town. In July 1862 she took on the position of postmaster, and continued to fulfill these duties for free until 1878. She married Birt in 1873.

##### CONCLUSIONS

It would be easy to dismiss the role played by women in the development of a postal infrastucture in the Cape during the colonial era. Their number was, after all, hardly large, and were it not for the heroic roles that Johanna Walton and Sarah Glueck played during the South African War, it seems probable that little would have otherwise been known of them today. Thanks to the Military their actions were recorded and brought to the attention of Parliament, and are thus recorded for posterity. However there must be many similar stories of the life of a postmaster in a small platteland community that have been handed down in as part of family folklore, but which have been lost through lack of documentation. Personal histories are an important part of our development as a family, as a people, and as a nation, and unless we are willing to record them, a little of our heritage is lost every time that one of us joins the ranks of the ancestors.
