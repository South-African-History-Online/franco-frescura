description: "Political cartoons, the John Burger Saga, and satirical artwork from the anti-apartheid era."
---

Franco Frescura's graphic work represents a powerful visual commentary on South African society during the apartheid era. His satirical cartoons, particularly the John Burger Saga, used humor and sharp observation to critique political and social issues of the time.

This collection includes political cartoons, satirical artwork, and student graphics that document a critical period in South African history through the lens of an artist-activist.
