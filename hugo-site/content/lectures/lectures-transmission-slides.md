#####   
TRANSMISSION AND CHANGE IN ARCHITECTURE SLIDE LECTURE

Franco Frescura

**Slide 1** (Symbolic) The concept of a "_style_ ", as it is commonly used in the visual arts, or most particularly in architecture, arises from an era when man, imbued with the idea of a "_scientific method_ ", was beginning to rationalise and find patterns in his natural and physical environment. Although this represented an important tool which enabled early architectural historians to understand and catalogue their built culture, ultimately its implementation was flawed in that it concentrated upon the finished product to the exclusion of the processes which created it.

**Slide 2** (Symbolic) This means that outward elements of visual similarity became sufficient reason to create generic labels which ignored the social and economic background of a building or the cultural values it represented. This is wrong, for an analysis of these processes and the means of production used reaches beyond those elements of aesthetic similarity and reveals the true nature of an architecture. It also means that the transmission of aesthetic elements from one generation to the next becomes more concerned with questions of method than with mere visual borrowings.

**Slide 3** (Piranesi: Pantheon, Roma) This does not mean to say that the transmission of architectural forms may not have taken place visually from generation to generation, from culture to culture and from place to place. They have, but these are only possible once certain preconditions of technology and production present within a source group have also been met and incorporated into the social processes of a recipient group. This means that the challenges of production have to be mastered and its technology has to become common currency within a community before transmitted aesthetic elements may be incorporated into a larger concept of a local "_style_ " and "_culture_ ".

**Slide 4** (Symbolic) This is important for it suggests that subsequent generations need not necessarily re-invent a technology, merely re-interpret it. As such then the transmission of aesthetic elements becomes part of a larger body of cognitive symbology whose meaning is generally understood but not necessarily spoken or consciously rationalised.

**Slide 5** (Symbolic) This paper is concerned with the mechanics of transmission in the architecture of pre-industrial society, primarily over a period of time, although elements of culture and distance will, unavoidably, also be discussed. It analyses their nature and possible origins in such diverse contexts as rural southern Africa, medieval Italy and early Muslim Palestine and thereafter seeks to derive some basic principles.

##### ELEMENTS OF TRANSMISSION

It is probable that, over the years, the transmission of architectural forms from one generation to the next, will take place through any number of different agencies, either individually or as part of a larger multi-faceted and overlapping series of patterns. Generally speaking however, these may be seen to fall into seven major areas of concern.

##### OUR FIRST SUCH AREA LIES IN TRANSMISSION THROUGH TECHNOLOGY

**Slide 6** (intersliding wedges) The art of building in any pre-industrial society may be seen to encompass a wide range of relationships between the producer, or builder, on the one hand, and the consumer, or owner, on the other. As this diagram illustrates, at the point where the contribution of the consumer, or Owner, is at its maximum, the role of producer and consumer are merged into one person. The owner is the Builder, and either conducts the work alone or, more likely, as part of a wider collaborative project involving the extended family, neighbours and friends. On the other hand, at the opposite end of the diagram, where the role of the Builder is at its maximum, then the Owner becomes a passive observer in a process of industrialized housing delivery. In reality, it is possible to have any number of levels of interrelationship between the two.

**Slide 7**(Daniell: Bushmen pastoralist and early Hottentots) This spans from hunter-gatherer, agriculturalist economies, where the role of producer and consumer are usually embodied in the same person,

**Slide 8** (medieval master builders) through to a late craft period where specialist artisans begin to arise in a community but where the consumer shares in the craftsman's knowledge and terminology and, should the need arise, may even be able to take part in his work. 

**Slide 9** (Johannesburg reflective glass).

**Slide 10** (making bricks, Gazankulu) During this time the transmission of building knowledge takes place as part of the everyday processes of life, where erecting a wall may be as much part of the daily household chores as cooking a meal or weeding the fields.

**Slide 11** (thatching, Mount Frere, Transkei) It often involves all members of the family group and each person will have an allotted task to perform, according to their age and gender.

**Slide 12**(thatching, Mount Frere, Transkei) Even where master craftsmen do arise the client is still able to enter into debate over the building process, being familiar with the technology being used as well as its limitations. It is only once the technological and aesthetic principles employed are removed beyond the grasp of the average consumer that he, or she, will become alienated from the building process and usually employ a specialist designer to act on his, or her, behalf.

**Slide 13**(medieval arcade, Pisa) This relationship between consumer and producer however also assumes that the "high" technology and design practices of one era may, with time and usage, become familiar to the average consumer of a subsequent era and thus be reduced to the level of a folk or craft tradition.

**Slide 14** (Rocca di Tivoli) It also means that an existing "popular" technology may be re- interpreted by subsequent generations to produce new forms and buildings in order to fulfil a new set of functions.

**Slide 15** (Rocca di Tivoli).

**Slide 16** (stonemason's markings, Pisa Cathedral) The transmission of technology during this time will probably be achieved through daily contact, practical experience, peer group association and tuition from elders, although during the latter part of this period trade guilds would also be a powerful influence. Ultimately, however, it is the guild system which serves to alienate the consumer from the building process and necessitates the introduction of specialist designers.

##### OUR SECOND AREA INCLUDES TRANSMISSION THROUGH SOCIAL CUSTOM

**Slide 17** (erecting a roof, Tabankulu, Transkei) This is likely to play a strong role in those communities where the building process is used to reinforce social structures and interpersonal links. In such groups the construction of shelter is part of a larger pattern of survival techniques which also include communal co-operation at such times as planting, harvesting and warfare. Rural man gains a large measure of personal identity through participation in such activities, knowing that he is cooperating in the survival of the group and that, when the need will inevitably arise, his neighbours, in their turn, will also render similar assistance. Thus when a community gathers to build a dwelling for one of its members they tend to erect forms common to the group, in a technology they all understand. Should the family being assisted request that their dwelling be built in a new form or use a new technology then, in doing so, they will be excluding a large proportion of their neighbours from the building process, thus removing them from the cycle of mutual indebtedness and weakening the social links which bind them.

**Slide 18** (view of medieval Pisa) Social custom is perceived by many to be a conservative force which does not promote the experimentation of either new forms or new technologies.

**Slide 19** (Qamata, Transkei) Nonetheless the outwardly-apparent uniformity of many rural dwellings may be perceived to affirm and reinforce an individual's sense of identity and position within that community.

**Slide 20** ("Peppermint Palace", La Lucia) This contrasts sharply with the stance taken by industrialized groups whose values usually decry uniformity and believe that "identity" can only be expressed through a differentiation of housing. Thus rural and pre-industrial man may be said to achieve personal identity and social status through a process of co-operation and integration; urban and industrialised man achieves this through alienation and separation.

##### THIRDLY WE HAVE TRANSMISSION THROUGH BUILDING FUNCTION

**Slide 21** (arch pedimented window, S Giovanni Laterano, Roma) This refers to the process whereby a structural element of a building, designed to meet the performance criteria of one material, may find itself overtaken by either a shortage of this material, the availability of a new material or the invention of a better technology. Instead of redesigning those parts involved in order to meet new conditions, many elements in the past have displayed a tendency to retain their older form in spite of its potential inefficiency. This may be attributed to the social inertia inherent in the building practices of many pre-industrial societies. Examples recorded include the translation, during Grecian times, of a timber post and lintel system to stone technology, and the retention of pedimented wall openings after the invention of self-supporting lintels.

##### THE FOURTH AREA IS TRANSMISSION THROUGH ARCHITECTURAL FORM

**Slide 22** (Piranesi: Basilica in the Forum Romanum) This refers to such cases where a building designed to fulfill the specific needs and social functions of one group, is taken over by another group whose new and quite different requirements are met by the same architectural forms or spaces. The particulars of such cases vary greatly. The growing Christian community of Rome, for example, discovered that many of its religious needs could be met, with little alteration, by the Basilican law courts of the previous order. Thereafter the transformation of the Roman basilica to the cathedral of Gothic times took nearly 800 years to achieve but the two forms remained nonetheless related through a series of slow evolutionary changes which involved both architectural form and building technology.

**Slide 23** (Baptistry, Firenze) Similarly in medieval Italy the imposition of circular baptisteries upon the sites of previous Vestal temples,

**Slide 24** (Temple of the Vestals, Roma) being sites dedicated to the hearth, woman, the home and hence fertility, must also be seen as the continuation of earlier social practices under the vestige of a new ideology and function -much like the Roman Saturnalia was eventually supplanted by a Christian Christmas.

##### THE FIFTH AREA IS TRANSMISSION THROUGH MATERIAL EXPORTATION

**Slide 25** (Dome of the Rock Mosque, Jerusalem) The physical translation of architectural ideas and technologies from one country or society to the next, has been recorded variously during past eras and has taken many forms, from the employment of foreign architects to the removal of whole buildings and their reconstruction on another site. The outcome however has not always been successful as many of the resultant buildings have failed to meet the expectations of either their users or their creators. Perhaps it is for this reason that we tend to know about those examples which have succeeded rather than where the opposite has been true. One such case in point is the visitational mosque of the Dome of the Rock, begun by Byzantine architects and craftsmen in 688. The mechanics of such transmission may also be found in the medieval guild system which permitted master craftsmen engaged upon a journey or a pilgrimage to exchange trade secrets with colleagues in other towns.

##### TRANSMISSION THROUGH THE REUTILISATION OF ELEMENTS

**Slide 26** (Roman marbles reused in the Cathedral at Pisa) This involved the physical removal of structural elements from one building and their re-utilisation in another. The practice may have been intended primarily as a form of cheap construction, but it also served to maintain a sense of continuity from one era to the next and insured that the basic textures of such buildings remained within a larger tradition of local architecture.

**Slide 27** (window detail, Church of S Silvestro, Tivoli)

**Slide 28** (medieval palazzo, Tivoli)

**Slide 29**. (Colosseum, Roma)

##### FINALLY WE HAVE TRANSMISSION THROUGH ARCHITECTURAL SYMBOLISM

**Slide 30** (doorway, Laura Sindell, Seattle) Elements of architecture may, in many ways, be perceived to have become symbols of other and often more complex ideas. A doorway, for example, may also act as a focus for concepts of privacy, threshold, transition, passage, entry, security and, in some societies, birth. A window, as the name suggests, was originally called a "wind hole" with obvious connotations of ventilation and may have had little to do with its more recent functions of lighting, socialisation, communication and social status. Certain building forms may, with time, also become synonymous with selected functions. Banks, universities and government structures, for example, all arouse specific stereotypical pictures in our minds which produce strongly identifiable images and metaphors.

**Slide 31** (Colosseum, Roma) In this respect, perhaps one of the most influential structures recorded in our architectural history has been the Colosseum in Rome, not so much for its form or functions, as for the symbolism inherent in its construction.

**Slide 32** (Colosseum, Roma) Its facade with its original graduation from simple Doric at ground level, to Ionic on the second and ornate Corinthian on the third, uses these orders as metaphors of the larger social structuring of Roman society, from the nobility through the merchant classes down to the plebs. Significantly, once inside, the social order was inverted although the ground floor exits, all eighty of them, were commonly referred to as the vomitorium for the manner they could disgorge spectators from the building . The articulation of the Colosseum exterior has been a powerful regulating influence upon the facade aesthetic of buildings through to present times.

**Slide 33** (medieval palazzo, Firenze) The most notable of these was perhaps the Renaissance palazzo with its rusticated ground floor, the grand first floor or piano nobile and the most comfortable rooms, the family's apartments, on the top floor.

**Slide 34** (Renaissance palazzo, v Matteo Palmieri, Firenze) A strongly projecting cornice terminated the building against the skyline.

##### THREE CASE STUDIES

**Slide 35** The Dome of the Rock complex in Jerusalem consists of the following buildings: the Dome of the Rock visitational mosque begun in 688; the Dome of the Chain built contemporarily to the Dome of the Rock; …

**Slide 36** … and the Mosque of al-Aqsa, rebuilt in 710 and drastically altered in the 1940s. This complex owes much to a Byzantine centralised church tradition as well as the more conventional devotional church plan adopted through a later Coptic Christian influence.

**Slide 37**

**Slide 38**

**Slide 39** The buildings on the Campo dei Miracoli at Pisa, comprise of four main structures: the Cathedral built in two stages between 1063-1118 and 1261-72;

**Slide 40** the Campanile built between 1174-1271 and with the bell storey being added in 1350;

**Slide 41** the Baptistry built 1153-1265; and the Campo Santo begun in the 1200s. These structures owe much to local architectural traditions, …

**Slide 42** … starting in the ninth century with the erection of San Paolo a Ripa d'Arno, as well as nearby Roman remains which were extensively plundered and incorporated into these buildings.

**Slide 43** The Cathedral complex of Firenze consists of the following buildings: Santa Maria del Fiore, begun in 1296 in direct competition with the Pisan example, and continued until 1434 when Brunelleschi's cupola was completed;

**Slide 44** the Baptistry built during the mid-11th century; and the Campanile begun by Giotto in 1334 and completed in 1359 after his death.

Read in their wider geographical context these three groups of buildings exhibit a unity of forms, functions and decorative motifs which places them firmly into a larger Mediterranean architectural tradition. Each has used common elements such as the centralized church, the devotional church, the dome and the tower as parts of their planning; each has used a variety of decorative patterns within the individual buildings which, in spite of their diversity, still manage to combine and harmonise, as part of the whole; each has also plundered pieces from the buildings of previous eras and incorporated these into their own.

##### SOME CONCLUSIONS

**Slide 45** (Laugier: Making the Humble Hut) Although the processes of architectural transmission discussed above have been separated and itemised for the sake of discussion, it will be obvious that these are either largely overlapping or, in a couple of cases, that they represented different aspects of the same argument. Thus the mechanics of such a transmission cannot be attributed to any one single factor but must rather be seen as the product of any number of these acting as a whole.

**Slide 46**(Symbolic) As such then they cannot be separated from the activities of man or, more specifically, his thinking, prejudices, values and perceptions. If we are to consider the artifacts of man, his buildings, not as products but as the result of a number of interactions, then it becomes reasonable to assume that the choice of forms, textures and aesthetics is not the brainchild of a series of idiosyncratic designers acting in isolation, but rather the work of persons working within the values and norms current to their own time and society. These do not exist in a vacuum but are linked to, and are indelibly formed by, those of previous eras.

Therefore when the builders of the churches, baptisteries and campanili of the post-Roman era designed these structures, they were acting within the constraints and practices of their own times. They did not have to re-invent what they used, but merely to re-interpret it, adapt it or reuse it and, in spite of making small, idiosyncratic changes in the process, they continued to practice the same architectural traditions begun by the generations before them.

If we can view such traditions to comprise not a style, but a maniera, a way of doing things, then quite clearly also we are dealing with a larger language of architecture - a vocabulary rich in nouns, idioms and metaphors, having a "high" as well as a "folk" tradition - which is transmitted from generation to generation as a cognitive, unspoken tongue. Like society which gives rise to it, it is not homogenous nor does it remain static and unchanging. It also acts as a banner, a pennon identifying its builders as surely as any battle colours.

##### Slide 47 (The End)

##### POSTSCRIPT

This lecture was developed following one of my research trips to Italy in the 1980s, when I began to realize not only that most books on architectural history were based, to my way of thinking, on any number of false premises, but that the processes of African vernacular architecture could provide some valuable lessons as to the “ _why’s_ ” and “ _how’s_ ” of European architecture. Laugier had understood this as early as 1727, when he admonished us never to forget the lessons that could be learnt from a “humble hut”, but this was ignored by architectural historians in their subsequent rush to create a concept of “style” in their efforts to support the budding nationalist movements of the 19th and 20th centuries. Sadly, this is a lesson which has still to be re-learned, and the concept that aesthetics can be neatly catalogued according to set stereotypical principles lives on to plague art and architectural education to the present day.
