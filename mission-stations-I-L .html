        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;We met a kind reception from Robert  Niven, who was residing alone, in a stone house consisting of a few plain  rooms, one of which was used for a school. There were a few (Xhosa) huts near  his dwelling, and fifteen kraals within six miles.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;At sunrise, a congregation of about  eighteen (Xhosa) and (Khoikhoi), assembled in the temporary chapel, a large,  beehive hut, neatly seated with wicker forms, in concentric circles, and with a  projection from the interior base of the wall, covered with cow-dung and clay.  A little pulpit and reading-desk, neatly covered with printed-cotton, were  opposite to the door, which was also of wickerwork&quot;.</em></p>

        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;The Mission village of Lily  Fountain, which is represented in the accompanying cut, takes its name from the  growth of &quot;Zantideschia ethiopica&quot;, the Lily of the Nile, in the  spring at this place: it consists of a plain, substantial Mission-house, and  some other buildings, used as a school-house and stores; also a chapel,  standing at a distance from these, as well as some cattle-kraals, and a  considerable number of mat- huts. The first house erected here, was built by  Barnabas Shaw, the first Missionary at this station, who also made the first  plough used here, and first taught the Hottentots of the Kamiesberg to  cultivate the soil&quot;.</em></p>

          KAT RIVER SETTLEMENT, Cape: LMS 1829. It was visited by James  Backhouse in January 1839 (p 189), who recorded the following:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;The Kat River country is the finest  in the Cape Colony: it owes its fertility and beauty to a lofty range of  basaltic mountains of picturesque outline. They are crested with crags, and are  grassy on their irregular slopes, and wooded in their kloofs, from whence issue  streamlets that irrigate the valleys. These are well cropped with Meelies or  Indian Corn, (Maize), and Potatoes, and are interspersed with little villages,  formed of the rude, beehive-shaped, grass-huts of the Fingoes, the house-shaped  ones of the poorer (Khoikhoi), and the neat cottages of those who have become  more prosperous. Some of the last would not discredit the more respectable of  the labouring class in England. The walls are of brick, externally, of that  which has een burnt, and internally, of such as is only sun-dried: they are  plastered on both sides with mud, and are whitewashed internally. The roofs are  thatched with reeds, and Vines trained on poles, form verandas to some of them.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;In a few of the villages, school-houses  have been erected by the (Khoikhoi), which are fitted up on the plan of the  British and Foreign School Society. Some of these schools are supported by the  benevolence of private individuals in England, and the (Khoikhoi) contribute to  the support of the others. These school-houses, or in villages where there are  none of these, other houses, are occupied as places of worship, in which some  of the elders of the Kat River church generally conduct the services&quot;.</em></p>

          KCHALATLOLU,  Transvaal: No data available. Alexander Merensky reported as follows:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;The location for our new mission  station, Kchalatlolu, lies at the foot of the Kchalatlolu mountains, next to  the Sebeloane river. We proceeded to build a water piping system, followed by a  log house eight steps long and four steps wide, similar to the one in  Gerlachshoop. It had a window, covered with sack cloth, and a door, which was  closed at night with mats. Our labourers worked six weeks for a cotton blanket,  two to three weeks for a hoe. Boys and girls received a few beads or some brass  wire as wages&quot;.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;We began to build a larger house for  our missionary in Kchalatlolu. Andries Moloi, the translator, knew how to make  sun-dried bricks and 13,000 were manufactured. Poles for the rafters and beams  were bought from the natives and planks from chests (in which donations for the  mission station were sent from Berlin) were used for window frames and for the  shutters. These were in two sections, having a top and bottom part. The roof  was thatched and the floor made from smeared clay; the house was then white  washed inside and out. It had three rooms: the centre one was used as the main  working and living room, those on its left and right were the sleeping quarters  for my helper and I. All three windows had a covering of cloth, no glass being  available, and the main entrance had a stable door. The bedrooms were closed  off with a curtain&quot;. &quot;The side chamber in our little house in Kchalatlolu  was now used as a church&quot;.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;In 1864 the only house in  Kchalatlolu had three rooms, the middle one measuring 12 by 12 feet; cooking  being done outside. There was also a cattle kraal and a goat enclosure&quot;.</em></p>

          KICHERER, also known as BLIJDE  VOORUITZICHTSFONTEIN and SAK RIVER, Cape: LMS 1799. It was visited  by Henry Lichtenstein in 1805 when he reported as follows:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;Supported by the missionary  societies in England, which are tolerably wealthy, he came hither with a large  stock of sheep and cattle, and collected about him a considerable number of  Hottentots, and even of (San), whom he promised to maintain, provided they  would receive and follow the doctrines he should teach them. He built a sort of  church, near which the savages constructed their huts,* and they assembled daily  for the worship of God, and to hear him preach the gospel to them; but without  his ever thinking of paying attention to forming their minds and manners in any  other way. He, as well as Van-der-Kemp, seemed wholly to forget that mankind  were destined to work as well as to pray. Besides, these savages were taught to  pray in a language of which they understood not a word: their instructor  thought it sufficient for them to learn the prayers by heart, hoping that thus  they would learn the language, and then understand the prayers, how mystical  soever they might be.</em></p>
          <p><em>The plate here given represents the  missionary Institutions above described. Among the houses to the left, the  largest is the Church, as it is called, the habitation of the missionary; round  about are the huts of the Hottentots. Somewhat to enliven the scene, cattle and  goats are introduced, but the fact is, that the spot is entirely destitute of  food for these animals. Though the soil in the pass is mentioned as being  fertilized by a spring which flows from the rocks, that effect ceases close to  the house, and the whole plain is naked and barren.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;This church is really scarcely any  thing more than a little barn, for it consists of nothing but the walls, and a  roof, without any divisions or fitting up within. To the left of the entrance  is a sort of pulpit, built of stone, whence the preacher gives his  instructions, and in face of it are half a dozen benches for his auditors.  There is not the slightest trace of an altar, a cross, a picture, or any other  symbol of Christianity. Instead of these, in the dark back ground of the  building, is a bed, a table, a couple of stools, with leather thongs over them  for the seats, and a couple of old chests: these constitute the whole household  furniture of the pastor. A piece of parchment scraped fine, and stretched over  a hole in the wall, serves as a window: this is not substantial enough to keep  out the cold air, and not transparent enough properly to admit the light : the  building is about forty feet long and seventeen broad. Near it stand six or  eight pandokken, as they are called, a kind of huts made of reeds woven into a  wooden frame, which are inhabited by the principal Bastard-Hottentots: the  poorer have little low huts in the form of a hemisphere, which consist of a  skeleton of wood, with a mat drawn over it.</em></p>

        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;The mission-house at Knaps Hope was  a small, thatched, wattle and dab cottage. The Missionary and his wife, who had  five children, entertained strangers hospitably in this humble dwelling, but  their own health suffered from the closeness of the place in hot weather, and  from the draft to which they were exposed, when obliged to set open the doors,  and the shutters which supplied the place of windows&quot;.</em></p>

          KOBA MISSION STATION, near Thaba 'Nchu, OFS: Probable PMS.  Visited by Arbousset and Daumas in 1836, who recorded the following:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;About a thousand huts made of marsh  reeds, and each protected by a railing before it, compose the station. They are  dispersed over two large parallel hills, which are separated from each other by  a stream of water. Near the top, and looking down upon the town, stand the  church and parsonage, also two small buildings, one of which contains a  printing press, and the other the forge belonging to the station. It is peopled  chiefly by Barolongs, who came in 1834 from the north-west, and submitted to a  young chief of an amiable disposition, called Moroko. There are also some  Baharutsis to be found there, who are subject to an old morena, who was ruined  by Moselekatsi, in whose neighbourhood he formerly lived.&quot;</em></p>

          <p><em>&quot;Their dwelling, which is represented  in the accompanying cut, consisted of a house of two rooms, and two mat huts.  There were also at this place a rude cottage belonging to an absent trader, and  seven mat huts belonging to the people. Most of the persons connected with this  station, lived in the surrounding country&quot;.</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Later on, in February 1840, he also had  this to say:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;Michael Wimmer constantly left Kok  Fontein in the winter; he packed up three mat-huts, which then served as a  dwelling, a chapel, and a kitchen, and removed with his wagon and cart, to the  places where most of the people were sojourning&quot;.</em></p>

        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;At length we reached the foot of the  hills, and arrived at Komaggas, which is represented in the accompanying cut,  where a few cottages and mat huts, a little windmill, and some gardens, watered  by a copious spring, gave an interest to the scene, of no common kind, in this  wilderness.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;The buildings here were of rough  stone, and plastered; the chapel was seated with benches of mason-work,  plastered and whitewashed, wood being too scarce to be applied for this  purpose; none was to be had nearer than the Orange River, except from a few Kameeldoorns,  some of which had been sacrificed for making a neat pulpit, which was the work  of a brother-in-law of the Missionary. Three of the people had cottages; the  rest occupied mat-huts; of these there were only thirteen on the station;  sometimes there were more than thirty, and about 400 people, and from seventy  to 110 children in the school&quot;.</em></p>

          KURUMAN, also known as NEW LATTAKOO, Cape:  LMS 1818. It was visited by John Campbell in March 1820, when it was still  being referred to as New Lattakoo. He reported that:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;We found a commodious place of  worship had been erected, capable of containing about four hundred persons; and  also a long row of Missionary houses, furnished with excellent gardens behind.  In front of the houses, a neat fence composed of reeds has been constructed,  which improves the general appearance. We names the whole buildings attached to  the Mission Burder's Row, after the Rev George Burder, Secretary to the  Missionary Society.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;The Missionaries, with the few Hottentots  attached to the mission, have dug a canal from a distance of three miles above  the town, by means of which the whole water of the Krooman is led into the  extensive fields and gardens. I went to view this useful work after breakfast,  and found extensive fields of (maize), belonging to the natives on both sides  of the canal. Similar cultivation extends two miles higher up the river in the  same direction. Though the Krooman be emptied by the canal, it soon becomes  larger than before, in consequence of twelve or fourteen fountains issuing from  the ground, about a quarter of a mile lower down than the dam, and which  discharge nearly en equal quantity of water at all seasons of the year&quot;.</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>John Burrow, who accompanied the Smith  expedition in 1835, had this to say about the Station:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;The native town which lies at the  back of the Missionaries' is very large, and since the breaking up of Old  Lattakoo considerably augmented since Mateebe left this. His eldest son has, I  believe, been considered as the Chief although Mahura, Mateebe's brother,  living at Old Lattakoo, transacted all business. I went one evening to see what  they call a reed dance, which they always hold by moonlight, and first on  arriving at the cattle kraal where it was held, I could neither make head nor  tail of it. But on looking more attentively I saw in one part a number of  people blowing with all their might into reeds of different lengths, making a  most horrible, and at the same time ludicrous, noise. In the middle were a  number of men dancing, or rather jumping, stamping, sweating and making fools  of themselves, while the women ran round them, clapping their hands and  hollowing like so many mad creatures. Walking round to the opposite side to get  a better view of them I was astonished to see some of our people who, not  seeing me, were enjoying the fun as much as the Bechuanas themselves&quot;.</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Burrow was followed four years later by  James Backhouse who, in September 1839, recorded it as follows:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;The Kuruman Missionary Station,  which is sometimes called New Lattakoo, is situated by the side of the Kuruman  River, a clear, permanent stream, which rises at the Little Kuruman, disappears  at intervals, a few miles further from its source, and at length is only marked  by a dry water course, except in rainy weather. At the Missionary Station, the  back of which, is represented in the accompanying etching, its margin is  planted with willows, and its waters are employed in irrigating some fertile  gardens and corn-lands; below these, there is a piece of marshy ground, on  which rice has sometimes been grown. The houses of the Missionaries, which are  plain dwellings, in rural farm-house style, and the other buildings stand in a  line, on the side of the road, opposite to the gardens. They are built of hard,  dove-coloured limestone, and thatched. The chapel will holdupwards of 1,000  people. Behind the houses, there are several patches of the low, thorny,  &quot;Acacia Lattaku&quot;; among these, the burial-ground is situated; it is  marked by a few little piles of stones. Contiguous to the Station, there are  several Bechuana villages; others are scattered more remotely on the side of  the river, and in the adjacent country. Wood is so scarce, that the timber used  for the roof of the chapel was brought from the neighbourhood of Mosega,  distant about 200 miles&quot;.</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>John MacKenzie visited Kuruman in 1859 and  reported as follows:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;The present station, however, was  not commenced till A tract of about two miles of the country was bought by the  missionaries from Mothibe, and paid for with articles which Mr Moffat had  brought from Cape Town. Here were raised a large and substantial church, and  two good dwelling-houses, all of stone. I am about to speak of the higher moral  and spiritual structure which has been reared in this district; but having  myself made some acquaintance with the house-builder's tools in Africa, I feel  bound to mention with respect the solid stone walls and the well-constructed  roof of the Kuruman church. The station was laid out by Mr Moffat, who to his  services as land-surveyor and architect added with equal diligence the humbler  but no less necessary and arduous callings of quarryier of stones and hewer of  timber for the church. The walls were built by well-qualified stone-masons,  Millen and Hume. The roof was the work of the Rev R Edwards, for more than the  years connected with the Kuruman mission, afterwards resident at one of the  stations broken up by the Dutchmen of the Transvaal, and now missionary at Port  Elizabeth. These buildings were completed in 1839. The Kuruman station is one  of those &quot;marks&quot; in the country which would remain to testify to the  skill and power as well as Christian perseverance of its founders, were the  white men all expelled from the country, and driven back into the sea,  according to the dreams of (Black) soothsayers&quot;.</em></p>

        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;Lishuani, which is represented in  the accompanying cut, consists of a humble Mission-house, belonging to the  Wesleyans: it is situated among great rocks, at the foot of a sandstone cliff.  Near the Mission-house, there are a few mat-huts, belonging to some Griquas,  who removed hither from Old Bootchap, and in the vicinity there are several  Basutu villages. In this neighbourhood a few of the people were also residing,  who a few years ago, invaded the missionary-station at Lattakoo; they were  under a Chief named Tlalela. Not thinking themselves safe in the Zoolu country,  to which they returned, they fled into that of Moshesh, who received them  peacably, and appointed them this place, where they now cultivate the ground in  peace. Being but a short distance from Lishuani, many of them resort thither to  listen to the glad tidings of salvation.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;The people were invited to a meeting  in the chapel, which is a large, hartebeest house. About seventy assembled,  whom we addressed through the medium of T Sephton&quot;.</em></p>

        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;In the eastern portion of the  valley, our attention was directed to a group of trees near some  well-cultivated fields, conspicuous among them being some eucalyptus, two feet  in diameter, and certainly not much less than sixty feet high. Beneath their  shade stood several houses built in European style. These were the quarters of  a missionary, whose instruction and example have had such a beneficial  influence upon the Baharutse, that they have become the most thriving  agriculturists of all the Transvaal Bechuanas.</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;In the fields round the mission-building  maize and wheat were growing, and in the gardens adjacent to the dwelling  peaches, apricots, pears, figs, oranges, and citrons were thriving admirably,  and, together with the vegetables, contributed a welcome addition towards the  support of the modest establishment. The little flower-garden revived pleasant  recollections by the abundance of old favourites it contained; there were  roses, both as standards and climbers, irises, lilacs with their graceful  bloom, and carnations with their pleasant fragrance; tulips and hyacinths had  been in bloom, but had now gone off&quot;.</em></p>

        <p>&quot;Helmore, writing in the hut beside  which my wagon stood, described those sufferings to a sister of her husband in  England - in a letter from which I give the following extracts:-</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;I write this in a pretty little hut,  14 feet by 12, built by your brother. The walls are of palmyra wood, and it is  thatched with palmyra leaves, so it answers literally to the name we have given  it - Palmyra Lodge, and though rough-looking on the outside it forms a  delightful shelter from the scorching rays of the sun. I should tell you that  it is 'hartebeest' shape, and has a window at each end, with thin calico  instead of glass. I only wish I were in a hut of similar description, but of  larger dimensions, north of the Zambese, instead of being still 200 miles south  of it, with the prospect of another six weeks' journey; but I must be patient,  and leave fearing for the future to record the mercies of the past&quot;.</em></p>
