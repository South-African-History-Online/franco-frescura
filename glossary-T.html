		<p> TERUGHELLING. (Afrikaans). Also referred to as Skuins.  See under BATTER or RAKE.<br />

		<p> THATCHING HORSE. A timber beam which is suspended by  means of rope from the apex or the ridge of a roof to be thatched.

The early wooden forms, with sculpted uprights  and slightly curved open scroll-type cross-pieces decorated with reliefs,  influenced the forms of later stone toranas.</p>
		<p> TORING. (Afrikaans). Also referred to as Spits.  See under STEEPLE.</p>

		<p> TRIKUTA. (Indian). &quot;Three-hall&quot;;  a triple-shrined structure.</p>
		<p> TRIRATHA. (Indian). &quot;Three-ratha&quot;;  the side of a pedestal or building that is offset so that its length is divided  into three sections.</p>
		<p> TROGILUS. (Afrikaans). See under SCOTIA.</p>
		<p> TRUSS. A frame built to carry a roof or other  load, its component members being designed to act either in tension or  compression. (Afrikaans: raam, in general, or dakkap, when  applied to roofs).<br />

		<p> TSHITANGA. (tshiVenda). Term used to describe a  kitchen or indoor cooking area. It plays an important role in the structure of  a Venda homestead in that it permits the wife to screen visitors before they  are permitted to visit the husband.</p>
		<p> Tshiukhuvha. (tshiVenda). A threshold.</p>
		<p> Tshivhaso. (tshiVenda). The hearth, quite  literally, &ldquo;a place for burning&rdquo;. This was the original name of Sibasa,  which was then distorted by white colonial administrators to its present form.</p>
		<p> TSONGA. An indigenous group inhabiting the  eastern littoral belt of southern Africa from Kosi Bay northwards to Sofala in  Mocambique. As a result of the Difaqane some groups moved westwards and settled  in an area immediately south of Venda which is today known as Gazankulu. The  people are more correctly known as the vaTsonga and their language is  referred to as siTsonga.</p>
		<p> TSWANA. A group indigenous to the interior of  southern Africa who are today generally regarded by anthropologists as  belonging to a larger Sotho/Tswana identity. Although they originally populated  much of the highveld region, the events of the Difaqane forced many of them to  move westwards. Today they inhabit Botswana, parts of the western Transvaal,  the northern Cape as well as a small enclave in the Thaba 'Nchu district of the  Orange Free State. The people are more correctly known as the baTswana  and their language is referred to as seTswana.</p>
		<p> TSWANA ARCHITECTURE. The Tswana are best known for their use  of circular plan, cone on cylinder dwellings surrounded about their full  perimeter by a wide verandah. This form is known to have been built in the  western Transvaal, northern Cape and eastern Botswana region since the 1600s  and probably earlier. Although most such structures today comprise a single  living cell, in the past they are known to have reached a high degree of  sophistication, including in their plan a number of sleeping and storage areas.  Settlement is generally made according to clan affiliations, but the scarcity  of water in the region has led to the growth of large urban centres which, in  the past, have been estimated to have achieved populations of between 10,000  and 20,000 persons.</p>
