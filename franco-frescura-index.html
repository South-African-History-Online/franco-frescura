	        <p>This  section contains personal details, together with a small biography, an abridged  <em>curriculum vitae</em>, a list of my  publications, and highlights from my life as a graphic artist. I have also  included, without prejudice, interviews and reviews of my work, as well as unposed  portraits drawn by students.</p>

		<p><a href="architecture-index.html">ARCHITECTURE</a></p>
	    <p>This  is perhaps the most substantial section of the website, and includes articles on  indigenous architecture, colonial settlement, mission stations, and historical  conservation. A number of conservation reports on small colonial towns and  villages in the Eastern Cape  have been incorporated, although these will eventually be filtered off to a  separate website.</p>

	   <img src="images/urban-issues.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" /><p><a href="urbanisation-housing-index.html">URBANISATION AND HOUSING</a></p>
	    <p>The  deconstruction of the &ldquo;apartheid city&rdquo;  remains high on my wish-list, and I have grouped here a number of essays on the  subject. Associated with this is the topic of popular housing, and I have  included here a number of hitherto unpublished reports.</p>

	  <div class="icons">
	    <img src="images/teachers.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" /><p><a href="lectures-main-index.html">LECTURES,  TUTORIALS AND CONFERENCE PAPERS</a></p>
	    <p>This  section brings together the notes from a number of public lectures and  conference papers delivered since 1977, some being more complete than others,  but all hitherto unpublished. I have also included some university lecturing  and tutorial handouts, whose distribution has always been limited.</p>

	    <img src="images/standard-postage.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" /><p> <a href="graphic-work-index.html">GRAPHIC WORK</a></p>
	    <p>&ldquo;The  John Burger Saga&rdquo; has been reproduced  in all its scurrilous glory with a   selection of other graphics, largely of a political nature, and only some of  which have been published previously. Wherever possible these have been  contextualized. The stamp essays produced when I was employed by the SA Post  Office have been grouped in a separate section. </p>

			<p><a href="postal-history-index.html">POSTAL HISTORY</a><a href="postal-archives.htm"></a></p>
	  	    <p>The  bulk of this section is given over to research into the Cape  colonial Post Office, but notes on more recent South African stamp issues  published in &ldquo;Setempe&rdquo; have also been included. The majority of the longer  research papers only found publication in specialized journals overseas.</p>

				<p><a href="visual-archive-index.htm">VISUAL ARCHIVE</a></p>
		  	    <p>This  section is experimental, and aims to bring together images of southern Africa published on postcards between 1903 and the 1920s.  It includes indigenous architecture and customs, colonial architecture, and  small town settlement.</p>
