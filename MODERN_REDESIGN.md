# Modern Mobile-First Redesign

## Overview

This document outlines the modern, mobile-first redesign implemented for the Franco Frescura Archive website. The redesign maintains the academic research aesthetic while dramatically improving mobile usability, accessibility, and visual appeal.

## Key Features

### 1. Mobile-First Design
- **Responsive breakpoints**: Mobile (< 768px), Tablet (768px - 1023px), Desktop (1024px+)
- **Touch-friendly**: 44px minimum touch targets for mobile buttons
- **Optimized navigation**: Side-drawer menu for mobile with smooth animations
- **Flexible layouts**: Grid system that adapts from single column to 3 columns

### 2. Enhanced Visual Design
- **Modern color palette**: Warm terracotta and cream tones that evoke research and heritage
- **Smooth animations**: CSS transitions and transforms for cards, navigation, and scroll effects
- **Card enhancements**:
  - Subtle hover effects with lift and shadow
  - Gradient accent bar on hover
  - Image zoom on hover
  - Better typography hierarchy

### 3. Improved Navigation
- **Sticky header**: Remains accessible while scrolling
- **Dropdown indicators**: Visual arrows that rotate on interaction
- **Mobile menu**:
  - Slides in from left
  - Dark overlay backdrop
  - Expandable sub-menus

### 4. Accessibility

- **Semantic HTML**: Proper heading hierarchy and landmark regions

### 5. Performance

## Configuration

### Logo and Tagline

To use the logo and tagline features, add these parameters to your `hugo.toml`:

```toml
[params]
  logo = "/graphics/sun-logo.png"  # Path relative to static folder
  tagline = "Architecture, Heritage & Cultural Research"
```

If no logo is specified, the site will display the title without an image.

## Design Decisions

### Color Palette

```
Primary: #B8662C (Warm Terracotta)
Primary Dark: #8B4513 (Deep Sienna)
Primary Light: #D4915C (Light Terracotta)
Accent: #DAA520 (Goldenrod)
Background: #FAF6F0 (Cream)
Text: #2C2416 (Dark Brown)
```

These colors were chosen to:
- Evoke warmth and heritage
- Maintain academic credibility
- Ensure sufficient contrast for accessibility (WCAG AA)
- Work well with historical photographs and documents

### Typography

- **Body**: System font stack for performance and familiarity
- **Headings**: Georgia serif for academic gravitas
- **Responsive sizing**: Using `clamp()` for fluid typography
- **Line height**: 1.7 for body text, 1.3 for headings

### Spacing System

Consistent spacing scale based on rem units:
- xs: 0.5rem (8px)
- sm: 1rem (16px)
- md: 1.5rem (24px)
- lg: 2rem (32px)
- xl: 3rem (48px)
- xxl: 4rem (64px)

## Browser Support

- Chrome/Edge (last 2 versions)
- Firefox (last 2 versions)
- Safari (last 2 versions)
- Mobile Safari (iOS 12+)
- Chrome Mobile (Android 8+)
