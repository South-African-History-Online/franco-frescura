    <h5>POSTSCRIPT</h5>
    <p>This typology was developed in the context of courses I have  delivered to a number of post graduate student groups and historical amateur  bodies on the methodology of architectural surveying and conservation. The  forms reflected here have been reduced to a simple formula as a means of  facilitating field documentation. It has never been published except in the  form of student handouts.</p>
