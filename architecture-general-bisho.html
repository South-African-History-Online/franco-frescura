	    BISHO: A POST MODERNIST MIRAGE</h5>
	  Franco Frescura and Stephanie Volpe
	  <p>&nbsp;</p>
	  <p>The Ciskei  is not a happy land. The historical home of Khoikhoi, Mfengu and Xhosa, it  became, during the nineteenth century, the hunting ground of traders,  missionaries, immigrant farmers, labour recruiting agents and the military.  Their activities effectively scoured the region of much of its indigenous  traditions and material culture and effectively paved the way for the political  and social radicalism which permeates its society today.</p>
	  <p>The boundaries of what was to become known as the Ciskei  were established as early as 1913 when parts of this region were set aside by  the Union Government for exclusive black settlement. During the 1960s and 1970s  the area was used by South Africa  as a dumping ground for the forcible resettlement of many black residents of  the Cape. As a result some villages became  little better than rural slums where unemployment and starvation were endemic.  The Visagie survey of 1978 found that kwashiokor affected 27% of all infants in  the 6 to 23 month age group. As late as 1985 the Herman/Windham study  established that between 1970 and 1983 approximately one infant in every five  born in the region died before it reached the age of five. In 1980 the Quail  Commission stated that 95% of Ciskeian workers in employment held jobs in white  South Africa.</p>
	  <p>When the Ciskei  opted for independence in 1981 under the South African Government's Bantustan policy, it did so with the consent of  only a small minority of its population and against the specific  recommendations of its appointed consultants. In the process it inherited a  legacy of poverty unequalled in modern-day southern Africa.</p>
	  <p>The development of Bisho, the Ciskei's new capital, must then be  viewed in the context of these factors. The town lies some six kilometres north  of King William's Town on the main road linking the Cape to the Transkei and Natal. Its location was dictated by a wish on  the part of the Ciskei  to place an economic stranglehold upon the white community of King William's  Town who, Prog, Nat and HNP, stand united against incorporation into the  homeland. When questioned on the subject residents point, with some reason, to  the Ciskei's long history of political and economic mismanagement: the location  of a new hospital below the flood plain of the Keiskamma River by Israeli  &quot;experts&quot;; the building of an &quot;international&quot;  airport (to be followed by an international hotel) outside Bisho; the  purchase of a R36 million jet aircraft which cannot obtain a permit to fly; and  the string of internecine rifts, vigilante violence, attempted coups d'etat and  military invasions which have typified the government of President Sebe.</p>
	  <p>The visitor approaching Bisho is immediately struck by the  surrealistic image of the town rising abruptly out of the landscape. The odd  juxtaposition of a stranded CBD, ready- made and unsupported by a residential  component, against a backdrop of wide-open veld, is bizarre to say the least.  As evening approaches, day-trippers disappear into the veld leaving the streets  empty for the goats that amble along, &quot;wending their weary way&quot;  from nowhere to nowhere.</p>
	  <p>The Master Plan for the town has clearly been disregarded by the architects,  as buildings jostle with each other, each clamouring for attention. Neighbours  are rudely ignored and spaces between buildings carelessly abandoned to dust  and litter.</p>
	  <p>Most of the buildings are treated in the Post-Modern idiom, a  style of architecture intended to facilitate meaningful communication.  Ironically, virtually no references are drawn from the region or the culture of  the Ciskeian people. Unimpeded by the constraints of an established urban  setting and a sophisticated and critical audience, the architects are having a  field day. Given the prevailing laissez-faire attitude, buildings achieve  varying degrees of success. Some, such as the Post Office, even have  considerable merit.</p>
	  <p>Bisho is a town that is as unlovely as it is apparently unloved.  Perhaps Italo Calvino was right when he said that &quot;a town without old  buildings is like a man without a memory&quot;; but the problem with Bisho  lies not only in its lack of old buildings but in the quality of the new.</p>
	  <p>Ultimately the architecture of Bisho will not be judged by its  capacity to follow the dictates of international fashion so much as its ability  to meet up to the cultural expectations and economic realities of the Ciskeian  people.</p>
