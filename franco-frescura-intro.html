	    <h5>INTRODUCTION</h5>
	    <p>My  first article, commissioned by Percy Qoboza, editor of the now defunct  newspaper, The World, was published in May 1976. Since that time I have  written many thousands of words covering a wide spectrum of interests, from  political satire to housing, from indigenous architecture to cultural  conservation, and from postal history to social analysis. Some of these have  found publication in venerable academic journals and are now part of the  historical record, but many have ended up as wrapping for someone&rsquo;s  fish-and-chips dinner. Others yet have never seen the light of day, either  because they were too scurrilous, or too angry, or just plain boring.</p>
	    <p>During the course of my life as an  academic I have also delivered an untold number of lectures, usually to  students resigned to passing my courses, but sometimes as an invited speaker  before an interested audience. Barring those few that were later developed into  formal papers, most of these talks survive only as brief personal notes and  fond memories.</p>
	    <p>Architectural authors, in South Africa as  elsewhere, are often limited in their publishing options. Few journal editors  are able, or even willing, to carry in-depth research articles, preferring  photo-essays and PRO-generated micro thoughts to academic analysis. Architects,  it might appear, are picture-literate but suffer from reading inertia. As a  result most of my work has been scattered across a variety of journals, as  diverse in nature as housing, archaeology, culture, history, conservation,  building construction, property, planning and philately. </p>
	    <p>Much of this work was also published  during the 1980&rsquo;s, when the international community had, rightly, imposed a  cultural embargo upon apartheid South    Africa. As a result, local publishing  developed some distinctly parochial attitudes, many of which persist to the  present day, and many local academic journals never achieved the wider overseas  readership that they perhaps deserved. Although many of the articles and papers  reproduced here were submitted to local editors as a matter of choice, a number  of the journals they appeared in have since vanished, and access to back copies  has become a matter of archival archaeology.</p>
	    <p>Consequently this website sets out to  collect some of my research into an easily accessible data base which will make  it more readily available to students and colleagues alike, both here and  overseas.</p>
	    <p>This website is also intended as a  depository for a number of research projects which, at the time, found  publication as reports, and thus enjoyed only limited circulation. Many of  these, specifically in the field of historical and architectural conservation,  will ultimately be grouped to form the core of a separate website. At that  stage it is hoped that both SAHRA and other practitioners in the field will  also contribute their work to this database.</p>
	    <p>The concept of archiving data as a  research strategy is taken further in other areas, where a number of incomplete  and unpublished manuscripts have been made available for general access. It is  inconceivable that any publisher would ever consider the commercial  distribution of a book entitled The Postmasters of the Cape   of Good Hope, 1792-1910. Yet the manuscript is available and  is of interest, even if this is limited to a small group of genealogists.  Similar listings of mission stations, southern African building terminology and  colonial settlements suffer from the same limitation and have been included in  this section of the website. Pending their future publication, please accept  that the author has asserted his intellectual rights.</p>
	    <p>During the course of my research I  found that the documentation of southern Africa&rsquo;s indigenous architecture  ceased in the 1870s, when the focus of travellers began to shift northward to  Central and West Africa. The first major  anthropological studies of the region only began to be published in 1927,  leaving us with a fifty year hiatus in the anthropological and pictorial record  of the subcontinent. This lack became particularly noticeable once researchers  in other fields, such as History, Anthropology and Geography, also began to  identify this as a time when the colonial economy was beginning to have an  important influence upon the lives of our rural people. I soon found that  picture postcards, which first appeared in large numbers from 1903 onwards,  neatly filled this gap. However, it was only once my interests broadened to  include colonial architecture, that the value of this pictorial record was  fully realized. The visual archive included in this website is therefore  intended to bring together material which is not commonly available to  researchers and, given the nature of the collecting market, would require many  years and considerable expenditure to gather into one data base. It is intended  to act as a working document, which will be extended and amended from time to  time as additional material becomes available.</p>
	    <p>In due course, I am also planning to  make available to students my lectures on a variety of subjects, including  southern African folk architecture, colonial settlement, historical  conservation and graphic design. However, as these have a high pictorial  content, they may take some time to finalise, and your indulgence is kindly  requested. I have begun with a number of talks delivered in Italian in May 2007  to the School of Architecture,  at the Campus Leonardo of the Politechnico in Milan. Students of  Italian literature are requested to view these efforts with a little  forbearance.</p>
	    <p>It is unavoidable that the concept of  Open Access to data should also raise the question of intellectual rights. I  have no hesitation in making my published research available to colleagues in  the field for bona fide academic activities, including teaching, research and  reference. To this end these may be downloaded into hard copy and made  available to students on a non-profit basis. It is requested, however, that the  conventions of academic referencing be observed, and the name and details of  the journal which originally published each individual article are appended for  ease of quotation. Failure to do so may result in highly inappropriate  overreaction on my part.</p>
	    <p>Regrettably, the same courtesy could  not be extended to unpublished material, and while I am quite happy to share  this incomplete knowledge with fellow researchers, the constraints of copyright  do not allow me to make this work freely available.</p>
	    <p>For slightly different reasons  downloading of images from the visual archive has similarly been curtailed.  Researchers wishing to obtain copies of individual photographs are advised to  contact their owners directly.</p>
	    <p>One specific problem which arose  during the design of the website related to uniformity of presentation.  Originally it had been planned to merely scan in the original pages, but as  this made them less legible and difficult to download into hard copy, it was  decided to revise all typefaces, layouts and methods of referencing.  Consequently the appearance of the web pages bears little resemblance to the  original published product. However, I have withstood the temptation to make  cosmetic changes to the original text, hard as that may have been at certain  times.</p>
	    <p>I would like to extend my grateful  thanks to the many students and colleagues who have participated with me on a  number of important research projects. Wherever possible these contributions  have been acknowledged in the text, but should any errors or omissions have  taken place, please spare your lawyers&rsquo; fees and contact us on our website. We  shall be delighted to make what changes may be necessary. Thanks must also be  given to Joni Light and Jonas Jiana, of South African History on Line, who  designed this website and are responsible for its maintenance. Their hard work  and good humour have been largely responsible for its success. At the end of  the day, however, I remain responsible for its contents, and any editorial  failings should be laid at my door.</p>
