        <h5>APPENDIX B</h5>
        <h5>EIGHT MONTHS IN AN OX-WAGGON - 
          Reminiscences of Boer Life, 1880</h5>
        <p>EF Sandeman</p>
        <h5>EDITORIAL  INTRODUCTION</h5>
        <p>Sandeman visited Botshabelo Mission Station in about 1879 and a  description of his sojourn with Merenski may be found on pages 152-171 of his  book (1880). Although this text is being reproduced here in its entirety, some  minor editorial changes were found to be necessary. Terminology of a dated  racial nature has been replaced with words reflecting a more current usage,  while incorrect ethnographic or architectural references have been amended. However,  all such changes have been indicated by means of brackets. Some of Sandeman's  views on women and indigenous marriage practices, which may be found on pages  164-5 have also been omitted. However no effort has been made to amend the  author's opinions in any way. </p>
        <h5>ARRIVAL  AT BOTSHABELO</h5>
        <p>I had lunch at the camp, and left one of the horses there before  riding up to the Mission Station, which I reached at five o'clock, and was met,  at the door of his house by Herr Marensky in person, who, after I had seen my  horse stabled, took me into his little study to get a cigar and cup of coffee  before accompanying me in a stroll round the workshops, which would be closed  on Sunday. We first visited the blacksmiths, where probably the best work in  the Transvaal is turned out. There is only one  (white man), a German, in the shop as master and overseer, and the same applies  to the waggon-making, and general carpenters' shop. All the work is performed  by (indigenous workers) themselves, many of whom are thoroughly efficient  smiths and carpenters. About twenty (men) are constantly employed in the shops,  and when there is a press of work there are twice that number, who are  competent to do the rougher kinds of work. The master smith and master  wheelwright have each of them substantial well-built dwelling-houses close to  their work, and I expressed my surprise to Herr Marensky at their having had  the means at hand to build such excellent houses, for they far surpass the best  houses in Middleburg; but he answered me with an English proverb which well  expresses the spirit which pervades his whole policy and management: &quot;<em>What  is worth doing at all is worth doing well</em>.&quot;</p>
        <p>We returned to the house to get ready for tea. I was shown to my  bedroom, opening out of the little courtyard attached to the back of the house.  A snow-white little bed, a carpet of spring-bok skins sewn together, an ewer  and water-jug, were the sole furniture, and on the wall hung a roughly-painted  sacred picture. At tea I was introduced to Herr Marensky's wife and family; and  a very kindly welcome they gave me, and took every opportunity of showing me  any little attention, besides taking the most lively interest in our plans,  which I discussed at tea with the Herr Pastor, as there is no man in the  Transvaal who knows better the temper and probable movements of the (indigenous  population). I was also anxious, if possible, to obtain a (man) from him as a  guide, who was acquainted with the district and other tribes we might meet. On  learning my wish Herr Marensky at once sent down into the village below for a  man who he thought would suit me, and who had very lately returned from the  very district we intended making our head-quarters. After tea the pastor took  me back again to his sanctum and after presenting me with another excellent  cigar - one of a box lately presented to him by a gentleman he had nursed  gratuitously through a long fever - he proceeded to give me some account of the  station from its beginning, and which made a great impression upon me at the  time, as much from the clear, straight forward matter-of-fact manner, which  left not a shadow of a suspicion as to the minute veracity of every word he  uttered, as from the indomitable pluck and perseverance that had been  characteristic throughout of the missionary and his little band.</p>
        <h5>HISTORY  OF BOTSHABELO</h5>
        <p>Twenty years ago the pastor, first with only one companion,  settled down in the territory, and close to the (capital) of Secocoeni, and for  some months he was in great favour with that chief, until the numbers of those  who flocked to him - more, as he is the first to own, to obtain protection and  means of making a quiet livelihood, than with any thought or care of becoming  Christians - made Secocoeni jealous of the new power. For a couple of years he  was exposed to nothing worse than petty annoyances; but at last Secocoeni,  growing alarmed at the steady increase of the little colony, ordered him to  quit his territory. Herr Marensky, however, managed to conciliate him and  obtained his permission to stay on, the chief perhaps being more influenced by  the wishes of many of his principal head men (Indunas), who had received  benefits from the medical skill and remedies of the missionary, and whom they  regarded as a great medicine-man, than from any goodwill towards the pastor  himself. The third year passed peacefully away, and Herr Marensky had now been  joined by his wife; but there arose many slight squabbles, until at last came a  climax, in the demand for a fugitive, whom the missionary refused to give up to  the messengers from the chief. Next day a large party, led by two Indunas  personally unfriendly to Herr Marensky, surrounded the house, and in the most  threatening manner demanded not only the fugitive, but also that the missionary  should accompany them to the (capital). On his refusal they forcibly searched  the house and neighbouring (homesteads) for the man, killing many of the  harmless inhabitants, but failed to find whom they sought, for he was hidden  under the bed on which Frau Marensky, in a very delicate state was lying. As  Herr Marensky had gathered from their behaviour that they were not now  authorized to kill him, he assumed, a still bolder demeanor, and after soundly  rating them for their cruel behaviour, sent a message by them to their chief  that he could not leave his wife to visit him. The party then returned to the  chief's (capital); but just before night the pastor received a message from an  Induna whose life he had saved, and whose integrity he could rely on, that his  house was to be surrounded, and himself and family slain before morning.  Luckily he had a couple of horses at hand, left by a German farmer who was  himself only some twenty miles away, across the stream; so after calling  together all the (mission residents), he told them to join him as best they  could, beyond the river; and putting Mrs. Marensky on one horse and mounting  the other himself, he set out for the ford. Before the had gone many miles the  flames announced that the (Pedi) were at their deadly work, and more than half  the inoffensive station (men) were butchered before they had time to make good  their escape. The horrors of that night are still too vividly before his mind  for the pastor to speak lightly of them: his wife in a fainting condition, and  unable to sit her horse without support, and the yells of the pursuing demons  ringing in his ears, before at last the river was reached, and only just in  time, for a heavy flood was coming down and the channel was already swollen and  dangerous. Some of his own (men) were there before him, and with their  assistance his wife was brought over in safety; and that very night, as the  stars were giving way to the morning, his eldest child was born; and before his  pursuers reached the stream it was a huge cataract, with masses of turbid water  bearing down rocks and trees in their furious course, and utterly impassable by  man or beast.</p>
        <p>For many weeks he and his wife were protected and cared for by his  compatriot. Everything had been left behind in his flight, and they were  homeless and penniless, but anything but hopeless or repining, and he soon  fixed upon the spot where the station now rests for another attempt, and had  soon gathered the remnants of his little flock around him at the new home,  where they were speedily joined by other fugitives from the surrounding chiefs.  Thirteen years ago there was nothing but a barren waste; now he has a fine  church - certainly the finest in the Transvaal - 600 acres under cultivation,  stores, dwelling houses, workshops, and a huge (indigenous) village, all built by  himself and the (local black residents). The Society owns in all 39,000 acres  of land. 30,000 acres cost them &pound;500, and the 6000, of which the station  and most of the cultivated land form a part, cost only &pound;758;  there are besides 3000 acres which have been bought, but not yet paid for by  the (Black residents) themselves.</p>
        <p>The total population of the station is about 1600, of whom 1029  are baptized, 168 are under instruction, and 359 are children at school.</p>
        <h5>MISSIONARY  EFFORTS</h5>
        <p>Herr Marensky could, if he chose, baptise every man, woman, or  child in his village; but he makes baptism the reward of a good and virtuous  life, and not easy to be obtained. Children of Christian parents are naturally  baptized as soon after their birth as convenient. The work of conversion is  carried on almost entirely by the old converts; but the pastor observed, &quot;<em>More  is done by example than by anything else</em>&quot;. When a stranger comes and  announces his wish to join the community, he is at once given a piece of land,  and is assisted to build his (homestead), and is given land to till, and seed  to sow in it. But he is made to clearly understand the laws of the community;  that idleness will not be allowed, and will be visited by expulsion; that theft  will be punished by lashes and expulsion too; drunkenness, the first offence a  flogging, and the next a still more severe flogging, and expulsion into the  bargain; smoking daka is also visited with heavy penalties. After a time  the new comer will naturally have his curiosity aroused by the, to him,  mysteries of the Church, and the altered subjects of conversation amongst the  baptised; and, little by little, will himself wish to learn something of the  knowledge which he sees makes the others enjoy life in a way that is utterly  strange and new to him. He will also wish to be able to understand the curious  signs he sees the others reading, and to share in the ideas which enable his  associates to bear their troubles more easily, and which makes their domestic  relations so infinitely more happy; the wife and children obedient, cleanly,  and industrious, and the husband thoughtful and tolerant. Then the new comer  will apply to some of the (local) teachers, who will instruct him as far as  they are capable; and, at last, if he behaves well, he is admitted to one of  the classes taught and looked after by either Herr Marensky or his assistant,  Mr. Watson. If, at the end of five years, the man or woman, as the case may be,  appears to thoroughly understand the ceremony, and be fit to benefit by it, he  is at last baptised. If not, he enters into the body of catechumens, who are  allowed to be present in the church during the first part of the service, while  the communion-table is hid from their gaze by curtains, but are sent out before  the curtains are drawn aside for the commandments to be read from the table. He  remains a catechumen until such a time as Herr Marensky is convinced that he is  worthy of baptism - sometimes as long a time as fifteen years; and any misdeed  during this time puts it off indefinitely.</p>
        <p>The above are, as nearly as possible, the identical words of Herr  Marensky in answer to my questions as to the means of conversion used. No man  is ever under any circumstances solicited to embrace Christianity, and if he  conforms to the laws of the society he might live and die in whatever belief he  may happen to hold. Herr Marensky has nothing at all to do directly with the  interior economy of the settlement, which is left entirely to the management of  four chiefs, one of whom is a cousin of Secocoeni, and takes precedence of the  other three. These chiefs apportion to each man as much, or as little, land as  he can till to advantage, and settle what rent he shall pay for it; they settle  all their disputes, and investigate any cases of crime or drunkenness that may  occur. If any unusual difficulty arise, they at once refer it to Herr Marensky;  and also render him an account, at stated intervals, of their proceedings. His  consent has to be given before any man can either be flogged or expelled. He is  always ready to see and advise any of this people in any misfortunes that may  come upon them.</p>
        <h5>RELATIONS WITH THEIR NEIGHBOURS</h5>
        <p>It must not be supposed that it was all fair sailing for the  little settlement, when they had once taken up their quarters at Botsabelo. From  the very first they met with a most bitter opposition from the Boers, and were  also liable to frequent raids upon them by (marauding groups). Their very first  task was to build a laager, or fort, large enough to hold the entire population  and their stock; and on several occasions they defended it against large odds,  under Herr Marensky.</p>
        <p>The fort is situated upon the summit of a high knoll, and with  steep ascent to it on all sides. Walls, fifteen feet high and two feet thick,  pierced with loop-holes, and built of ironstone, enclose a space of seventy  yards square; there are flank defences, and a turret over the entrance, which  gives a clear look-out over to the surrounding country. Their first collision  with the Boers was caused by almost the same incident which drove them from the  territory of Secocoeni. A (man) who had been  desperately ill-treated by his Boer master, escaped, and fled for protection to  Herr Marensky. On careful inquiry it turned out that there was absolutely no  agreement of any description between the (man) and his master, and that he had  only been kept by force for many months past. Herr Marensky refused to  acknowledge any such legal slavery, as giving up the (man) would imply, and  told the Boers who came to demand his extradition, that they would have to take  him by force if they took him at all. The Boers retired to talk it over, and  presently returned in still larger numbers, bent on mischief; but the  missionary had meanwhile called out all his forces, and showed such a strong  front, that the Dutchmen very soon gave it up as a bad job, and retreated,  vowing vengeance. However, as they respected his strength and evident  determination of holding his own, they never more openly molested him.</p>
        <p>Only four years ago, while in the middle of the Sunday morning  service, the men in charge of the flocks burst in with the intelligence that a  large impey had suddenly come upon them, and driven away the whole herds. The  pastor, after one very short prayer (&quot;Nach einem sehr Kurzen Gebet&quot;)  for success, dismissed his congregation, with orders to instantly fetch their  arms; and in a very few minutes, himself at their head, they were on the trail  of their flocks. Just before dusk they came up with the enemy, who had been  impeded by having to drive the stock and were completely successful in the  engagement which ensued, inflicting heavy loss on the invaders, and rescuing  all but a few of the oxen which had lagged behind and had been assagaied out of  the wanton love of slaughter which characterizes (some people) when on the  war-path.</p>
        <p>Not long after this, one of the head men, coming up in the evening  to consult with his pastor on some domestic difficulty, detected a strange  (man) with a gun in is hands creeping in the shadow of the trees, towards the  open window at which Herr Marensky sat writing. Stealthily crawling along  behind him he was just in time to knock the gun out of his hands, as the  murderous wretch pulled the trigger, and the charge lodged harmless in the  window-sill. The would-be assassin, greased all over, and slippery as an eel,  wriggled himself free from his captor, who was at the time weak and ill, and  made good his escape before Herr Marensky could render any assistance in  detaining him; and, assisted by the darkness, managed to get clear away from  the enraged (residents), who were after him instantly to avenge the murderous  attack on their pastor.</p>
        <h5>THE BERLIN  MISSION IN SOUTH AFRICA</h5>
        <p>Throughout South Africa there are fifty-six missionaries and  thirty-four stations belonging to the Berlin Society; and although it may be a  doubtful point whether the work carried on by missionaries in the aggregate is  beneficial or the reverse to the interests of the country and the morals of the  (indigenous population) as a whole, yet there cannot be two opinions about the  improvement in the condition both mentally and physically of those who are  under the care of this particular society, which again almost entirely owes its  success to the common sense and practical principles which Herr Marensky  himself carries out and lays down for the guidance of the other missionaries of  the Society. The pay of these men, who carry their lives in their hands from  day to day, amidst hardships, ill-treatment, suspicion, and disappointments  almost incredible, is miserably inadequate, not only to their wants, but to  their absolute necessities. An unmarried man receives &pound;80  per annum, and a married &pound;100, and also draws &pound;3  per annum for each child when education becomes necessary. It is almost  imperative, however, for a missionary to be married, or otherwise he is  completely looked down upon by all (indigenous men) who have wives, and who do  not consider a man of any importance unless married, and in fact have no  hesitation in calling them &quot;<em>worthless boys</em>&quot;. When Captain  Clarke, as her Majesty's Commissioner, first sent to Secocoeni, that mighty  chief replied &quot;that Captain Clarke was only an unmarried boy, and what  could such a worthless fellow have to do with him&quot;. Herr Marensky was  himself unmarried for three years, and only obtained a degree of respect by the  intimation that he was just on the point of being married, and would soon bring  his wife to show them that he was.</p>
        <p>The most difficult question a mission has to deal with is the  treatment of (indigenous men) who wish to be baptized, but have more than one  wife. Personally Herr Marensky would not make it a sine qua non that the  man should put away all over the number of one, but the (converts) themselves  insisted on it, because they could not understand anything but one fixed hard and  fast line, and could see no reason at all why, if a man was baptized who had  several wives, a baptized man should not marry several. This feeling on their  part induced Herr Marensky to decree that when a man with several wives wished  to be baptized he should choose the wife he was most loath to part with,  irrespective of whether she was his first married or last married, and keep her  as his only one ...</p>
        <h5>COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES</h5>
        <p>Missionaries in general, are more opposed on account of the  stores, they often have attached to their station, than on any other ground;  and, in fact, nearly all the objections to their operations may be traced to  this source. I was anxious to hear what Herr Marensky had to say in favour of  the practice, which it was evident he approved of by the large store at his own  station.</p>
        <p>(Merensky asked) &quot;<em>Can you tell me any reason why a mission  station should not have a store? You and all others who have travelled, even  through the more civilized parts of the country, must be aware that it is  absolutely necessary for a traveller or hunter to trade to obtain any of their  ordinary produce from either Dutch or (Black farmers), and that money will not  buy what a tenth part of its value in merchandise will easily bring in. Why,  then, should the missionary be the only one who may not avail himself and his  people of this convenience? Again, if the (residents) of the station have no  store of their own to deal with, they will go to the nearest and there run into  debt, which ought at all times to be prevented; they will also be in the way of  obtaining spirits, which they can never do at the mission store</em>&quot;.  There are only two stores in all kept by the Berlin Society, and all the  profits, if there be any, are employed exclusively in building new mills or workshops.  The very houses the missionaries build for themselves are not their own  property, but the Society's, and belong of right to the next man who is  appointed to the station.</p>
        <p>Herr Pastor Marensky himself appears to be about forty-five years  of age, of a medium height, but powerfully built. He wears a beard, which, with  his hair, is iron grey in colour. His most striking feature is a fine broad  forehead, and very quick bright eyes give him a peculiarly vivacious, humorous  expression, and it needs but one glance to read the energy and determination in  his character, which have carried him through a life of such varied dangers and  difficulties. He is one of the most pleasant and amusing companions I have ever  come across.</p>
        <h5>CHURCH SERVICES AT BOTSHABELO</h5>
        <p>On Sunday morning we had breakfast at half-past seven, and then  the bell began to toll for the (indigenous language) service. The church is  within a few paces of the pastor's dwelling-house. The foundation-work is white  stone and the walls of red brick, and it has a thatched roof. It has a pretty  little steeple of galvanized iron, which in the sunlight shines like burnished  silver. The building is in the form of a cross, and capable of holding 1000  people.</p>
        <p>The service commenced at nine   o'clock, and by that time some 800 were collected in the church;  the men on one side and the women on the other: the catechumens seated nearest  to the door. There are no seats, except two pews for visitors and (Whites) of  the station; so nearly all the (Blacks) bring their stools with them but some  prefer squatting on the ground. All who come to church have to be decently  clothed. The younger portion of the small congregation were particularly smart  and gaudy, but none of the girls wore anything more gay than plain cotton dresses.  Many of the old men and women contented themselves with a blanket closely  wrapped round them. One group, in particular, attracted my attention among the  males. A young fellow, with a long blue shirt reaching to his knees, and above  it a rather well-cut Eton jacket, sat next to a very old fellow with snow-white  wool, who considered himself sufficiently got up in a blanket of many colours;  and next him a fine, tall, well-built man, clad in what had evidently been at  one time an embroidered lady's night-shirt, and under it a pair of well born  tweed knickerbockers, was taking charge of some blind aged relation, and  looking after his comfort most energetically by poking any body in the ribs who  seemed to be pressing him in too close.</p>
        <p>The singing was perhaps the most astonishing part of the whole  service, and would have done credit to any ordinary church choir in England. The  (indigenous population) take to part singing very quickly and Mr. Watson, the  under-missionary, an enthusiastic musician, spends all his leisure in teaching  the large choir he has been able to select from among the (youths) and women,  which accounts for their wonderful proficiency. When Sir Theophilus Shepstone  visited the station, the school children greeted him by singing &quot;God  save the Queen&quot; in English.</p>
        <p>In the afternoon there was a German service for those of the  neighbourhood who cared to come, but in all the congregation only numbered  twelve, including children. Afterwards Herr Marensky took me for a walk through  the settlement, and we paid visits to many of the (homesteads), all of which  were in the highest possible degree of cleanliness and order. Every (household)  had its store of mealie cobs hanging outside to dry, and many had large pockets  of (maize) as well. A funeral took place in the evening, and the whole  population followed the coffin to the God's acre, just outside the boundaries.  The singing was very touching and sweet, and no one could again call (sePedi)  an ugly language after hearing the hymns sung over the grave. When the service  was concluded, the men all stayed behind gathering stones, with which they  filled the poor fellow's grave, to prevent the jackals and hyenas unearthing  the coffin.</p>
        <p>During the day the newspapers by the post-cart arrived, and in  them was an account of the attempted assassination of the Kaiser. The  indignation and horror expressed by all sufficiently showed that distance had  not dimmed their loyalty for &quot;<em>Vaterland</em>&quot;. In the evening the  ladies gave us some music selected from Moody and Sankey's hymns, and several  national airs, before the whole family retired to rest at ten o'clock.</p>
        <h5>MOVING ON</h5>
        <p>Next morning, after breakfast, I was obliged to leave, although I  should have much liked to make a longer stay. While I was saying good-bye to  Herr Marensky, a (Black resident) came to the study, and made some complaint to  him the nature of which I did not understand till I saw him open his mouth  wide, and then squat down on the ground outside. Herr Marensky took down a case  of instruments, selected one, and for a second leant over the man; but before I  had time to see the operation he had extracted a huge black, three-fanged tooth  in the most masterly style, and without even removing the large pipe from his  lips. The wretched (man) never moved a muscle of his countenance, or uttered a  groan, but for a long time sat disconsolately in the same spot, spitting out  the blood which, however, he carefully covered over with sand before he went  away. Herr Marensky is as good a doctor, and perhaps the best surgeon, to be found  in the Transvaal, with the exception of those  at present with the troops, and who are called in whenever their assistance is  procurable.</p>
        <p>As a parting present Herr Marensky gave me various photographs of  his station and family, all of whom came out to wish me God-speed on my journey  as I rode away.</p>
