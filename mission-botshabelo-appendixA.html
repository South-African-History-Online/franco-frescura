        <p>APPENDIX A</p>
        <p>ADDITIONAL REFERENCES
          TO BERLIN  MISSION STATIONS IN THE TRANSVAAL</p>
        <p>DA MERENSKY</p>
        <p>EDITORIAL  INTRODUCTION</p>
        <p>In addition to his detailed account on the construction of his  mission at Botshabelo, Merenski also made reference in his book to the  establishment by the Berlin Missionary Society of a number of other stations in  the Transvaal. These included a number of  comments on their architecture and building technology which, having little  context, have been grouped here into a separate appendix.</p>
        <p>MAHAMBA MISSION STATION</p>
        <p>Three years after the death of king Rapusa of Swaziland, the  missionary Allison and his wife arrived at Matemba, capital of the Swazis. He  founded a station at the Umkonto   River. Then a brother of  the young king, Umswazi, contested the accession to the throne and, in the  skirmishes that followed, the Mission Station, which included the mission house  and the church, was destroyed. Allison and his wife fled to Natal and founded a Mission Station at  Edendale, near Pietermaritzburg. (Merensky, 1889: 9)(15)</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>RIETKLOOF  MISSION STATION, later renamed Gerlachshoop</p>
        <p>Gerlachshoop Mission Station was established next to Maleo's town,  fifteen German miles out of Lydenburg, on land donated by the chief. (Merensky,  1889: 22)</p>
        <p>The first thing we had to do was to rebuild the water channel,  which was 1500 paces long, a task which took fourteen days. Other labourers  erected thorn-bush fences for a kraal and I began a log house, the kind of  dwelling we always erect first on a new Mission Station. Other houses whose  walls consisted of sods, followed. Log structures last quite well just as long  as they are built with termite-resistant timber. Our corner posts are dug into  the ground and walls, made out of thinner poles, are placed between them.  Timber members are then nailed and bound to them horizontally. Reeds are placed  vertically in the gaps and, finally, a dagga packing is applied on the inside  and out. The walls and the dagga floor are finally smoothed over. The roof  consists of lightweight beams and is thatched. Our houses measured four paces  by eight; my little window was closed with a fixed piece of cloth but the door  was left open. At the river, where we found usable clay, we started a brickyard  employing some natives who had learned the trade during their years as migrant  labourers. We constructed the moulds and stone kilns and soon got to work  erecting a larger house made out of fired bricks. Because it is so difficult to  get, lime is used only as a whitewash. Limestone was carted in from a site  distant some five hours travel away from us, and was fired in an open kiln.  Using this lime as a mortar we laid a brick foundation to prevent termites from  reaching the woodwork of the walls and roof. Alas, in spite of this precaution,  within a year the thatched roof had become infested, but this stopped at the  end of the beams on the corner of the house where we had dipped the beam ends  into aloe sap and the trusses were of termite-resistant wood. (Merensky, 1889:  41-42)</p>
        <p>We taught  our workers to lay bricks. (Merensky, 1889: 44)</p>
        <p>The missionary learns to understand the natives, their customs and  character, by working alongside them at mundane tasks, such as those necessary  to make a station self- sufficient in housing and the production of food.  German artisans, sent out to establish the Mission Station, were of no great  help. They regarded the natives as servants and frequently misunderstood them.  The natives in turn would become bitter and suspicious towards the  missionaries. (Merensky, 1889: 45)</p>
        <p>BERLIN MISSION  EFFORTS IN THE TRANSVAAL</p>
        <p>By 1882 thirty mission stations were founded by the Berlin missionaries in  the Transvaal, but some have since been  vacated. (Merensky, 1889: 47)</p>
        <p>KCHALATLOLU  MISSION STATION</p>
        <p>Our new Mission Station, Kchalatlolu, lies at the foot of the  Kchalatlolu mountains, next to the Sebeloane   River. We proceeded to  build a system of water reticulation, followed by a log house eight paces long  and four paces wide, similar to the one at Gerlachshoop. It had a window,  covered with sack-cloth, and a door, which was closed at night with mats. Our  labourers worked for six weeks in exchange for a cotton blanket, two to three  weeks for a hoe. Boys and girls received as wages a few beads or some brass  wire. (Merensky, 1889: 80)</p>
        <p>We began to build a larger house for our missionary in  Kchalatlolu. Andries Moloi, the translator, knew how to make sun-dried bricks  and 13,000 were manufactured. Poles for the rafters and beams were bought from  the natives and planks derived from chests (in which donations for the Mission  Station were sent from Berlin)  were used for window frames and for the shutters. The latter were in two  sections, having a top and bottom part. The roof was thatched and the floor  made from smeared clay; the house was then white washed inside and out. It had  three rooms: the centre one was used as the main working and living room, those  to its left and right were the sleeping quarters for my helper and I  respectively. All three windows had a covering of cloth, no glass being  available, and the main entrance had a stable door. The bedrooms were closed  off with a curtain. (Merensky, 1889: 89)</p>
        <p>The side  chamber in our little house at Kchalatlolu was now used as a church. (Merensky,  1889: 114)</p>
        <p>In 1864 the only house in Kchalatlolu had three rooms, the middle  one measuring twelve feet square; cooking being done outside. There was also a  cattle kraal and a goat enclosure. (Merensky, 1889: 164)</p>
        <p>MEDINGEN MISSION STATION</p>
        <p>(We) founded our Mission Station, Medingen, next to chief  Kashane's village. (Merensky, 1889: 144)</p>
        <p>MISSIONARY  &ldquo;RESPONSIBILITIES&rdquo;</p>
        <p>The missionary has to be an authority on all subjects at all times  and to act quite decisively, especially in his dealings with the natives.  (Merensky, 1889: 157)</p>
        <p>GA-RATAO MISSION STATION</p>
        <p>We used sun-dried bricks made by the men from inferior clay.  Working with clay is usually women's work. The houses were built on a rocky  hill, with the foundations laid straight onto the rocks and the walls built  with sun-dried bricks. (Merensky, 1889: 180-1)</p>
        <p>(When we  built a chapel at Ga-Ratao the) people made bricks and fired them. (Merensky,  1889: 188)</p>
