		<p><strong>P</strong></p>
		<p>PAAL-EN-KLEI. (Afrikaans). See under WATTLE-AND-DAUB.</p>
		<p> PACAYATANA. (Indian). The five-temples (shrine,  support, above, resting place). In architecture, a temple that has a central  shrine surrounded by four others.</p>
		<p> Palelo. (seTswana). Roof batten.</p>
		<p> PALLIPPADAI. (Indian). In south India, a temple that  serves partially as a commemorative funerarymonument for a deceased royal  personage but is, at the same time, also dedicated to a deity.</p>
		<p> PACA MAKARA. (Indian). Also referred to as the five  &quot;m's&quot;. In Hindu Tantric practices, the enjoyment of the  company of women (mudra), the drinking of wine (mada), the eating  of flesh (mamsa), the eating of fish (matsya), and sexual  intercourse (maithuna). They are so called because in Sanskrit all the names  of these things begin with the letter m. Some lists substitute human sacrifice,  the use of the human skull as a drinking vessel, and the singing of lusty songs  for some of the practices. Although the five m's are not specifically  mentioned as a group in Buddhist texts, the same practices occur in Tantric  Buddhism.</p>
		<p> PANCARATHA. (Indian). &quot;Five-ratha&quot;;  the side of a pedestal or a building that is offset so that its length is  divided into five sections.</p>
		<p> PANCAYATANA. &ldquo;Five temple shrine, support, abode  or resting place&rdquo;. In architecture it is a temple that has a central shrine  surrounded by four others.</p>

		<p> PANEL. A compartment, sunk or raised, to be  found in walls, doors and ceilings. (Afrikaans: paneel).</p>
		<p> PAN TILES. Clay roof tiles, curved so that when  laid upon a roof, each overlaps the edge of adjacent tiles and prevents  moisture penetration. (Afrikaans: dakpanne).</p>
		<p> PARALLEL ROOF HOUSE. Rectangular structure two rooms deep,  each row being roofed separately thereby giving the building its characteristic  M-profile. (Afrikaans: M-dak huis).</p>
		<p> PARAPET WALL. From the Latin parare, meaning to  protect and pectus, meaning breast. The portion of wall above  the roof gutter or roof surface. Also applied to the same feature, rising  breast-high, in balconies, platforms and bridges. (Afrikaans: borsweringmuur).</p>
		<p> PARGETING. Also called Parge-work; the exterior  plastering of a wall, usually moulded into designs of a geometrical or foliated  nature. (Afrikaans: sierpleistering).</p>
		<p> PARIKRAMA. (Indian). Meaning circumambulation  or roaming about. The walking about in a circle about a deity or a  religious structure, performed as part of religious practice. When  circumambulation is performed with the object of veneration to the right of the  devotee, that is to say with the devotee moving in a clockwise direction, the  circumambulation is called pradaksina; when the object is to the left  and the worshipper moves in a counterclockwise direction, it is called prasavya.  Clockwise movement is considered to be auspicious; counterclockwise movement is  inauspicious, and generally associated with death.</p>
		<p> PARIVARALAYA. (Indian). A shrine for a parivara  deity.</p>
		<p> PARNAGHATA. (Indian). Vase-of-plenty.</p>
		<p> PARSVA DEVATA. (Indian). A side-deity; secondary  deities of an iconographic program, usually placed in subsidiary niches in a  temple.</p>

		<p> PEDIMENT. A low-pitched gable above a portico, a  door or a window opening. See also BROKEN PEDIMENT and OPEN BED PEDIMENT.</p>
		<p> PENDANT. A hanging ornament.</p>
		<p> PEW. Fixed wooden seat in a church.  (Afrikaans: kerkbank).</p>
		<p> PFAMO. (tshiVenda). Term for a chief's  dwelling.</p>
		<p> PHAMSANA. (Indian). A peaked, pyramidal roof  rising from a square base.</p>
		<p> PIDHA. (Indian). Horizontal, platform-like,  divisions or courses of the superstructure over the jagamohan (mandapa)  of an Orissan temple.</p>
		<p> PIER. From the Latin petra meaning  rock. The load-bearing brickwork in a building between openings. Is built on  one or both sides of a wall, in which case it is known as a pilaster.  (Afrikaans: pilaar or pyler).</p>
		<p> PIERCED DECORATION. Fretwork pattern cut in a timber barge  board. (Afrikaans: steekversiering).<br />
		  PILAAR. (Afrikaans). See under PIER.</p>
		<p> PILOTIS. From the French, meaning stilts. A post  or column projecting through an open ground floor space to carry the structure  above. Also could be interpreted to mean a pile or stake.<br />
		  Pinagare. (seTswana). A center post used during  roof construction, when it carries the greater part of the thatcher&rsquo;s live  load. After the roof has been completed, it is cut off immediately below the  cross-brace. Should the roof require subsequent maintenance or re-thatching, a  new center post is inserted immediately below it as a temporary prop. In many  larger Tswana dwellings the center post is not removed.</p>
		<p> PINNACLE. The raised end in the ridge surrounding  a gable and point of a hip. Also a small turret or tall ornament, usually  tapering towards the top. (Afrikaans: spitstorinkie).</p>
		<p> PISTA. (Indian). In Orissan architecture, the  platform or base comprising the lower portion of a temple.</p>
		<p> PITHA. (Indian). Seat or throne. The pedestal  of an image or linga.</p>
		<p> PLAFONBALK. (Afrikaans). See under CEILING JOIST.</p>
		<p> PLAT GRAFSTEEN. (Afrikaans). See under LEDGER.</p>
		<p> PLINT. (Afrikaans). See under PLINTH.</p>
		<p> PLINTH. The projecting base, stepped or moulded,  of any building. Also applied to the lowest square member of the base of a  column. (Afrikaans: plint).</p>
		<p> PLOUGHED-AND-GROOVED. Method of panelling, also called feather  jointing, similar to modern tongue-and-grooved. (Afrikaans: tong-en-groef).</p>
		<p> PORCH. From the Latin porticus. A  covered entrance to a building. (Afrikaans: buiteportaal).</p>
		<p> POST. A main vertical support of a building  frame or a partition or a sub-frame. (Afrikaans: styl).</p>
		<p> PRADAKSINAPATHA. (Indian). A passageway or walkway for  circumambulation surrounding an image, shrine, or building. In Western  literature, the term is used generically to refer to all circum-ambulatory  passageways. However, since the term pradaksina implies only clockwise  movement, the name may be inappropriate for some forms of circumambulation  which are performed in a counterclockwise (prasavya) direction.</p>
		<p> PRAKARA. (Indian). An enclosure wall, or the  enclosure wall and the compound created by the wall in a south Indian temple:  or a covered walkway that serves as an enclosure boundary in a south Indian  temple.</p>
		<p> PRASTARA. (Indian). A flat surface; a flat top; a  level. In architecture, the entablature above the wall of a structure.</p>
		<p> PREFABRICATED  BUILDINGS. The  concept of prefabricating buildings within a factory environment appears to  have begun in Britain during the early years of the nineteenth century when  colonial expansion created a ready market for high quality transportable  housing. Although these structures were initially in timber, the subsequent  introduction of industrialised building elements such as corrugated sheeting  and cast iron trims served to enlarge and enrich the range of textures and forms  possible under such a system of construction.</p>
		<p> PULATA. (tshiVenda). From the Afrikaans plat,  meaning flat. Term used in Venda to describe a mono-pitch roofed, square plan  dwelling.</p>
		<p> PURLIN. A horizontal timber piece or beam in a  roof, at right angles to the principal rafters or trusses, and carried on them.  It carries the common rafters, if any, or the corrugated sheet. (Afrikaans: kaplat).</p>
		<p> PURLIN ROOF. A roof for small houses, in which the  purlins are carried on the gables or the cross walls, rather than on a system  of trusses. (Afrikaans: kaplatdak).</p>
		<p> PYLER. (Afrikaans). See under PIER.</p>
