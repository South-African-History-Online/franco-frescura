        <h5 align="left">FOLK ARCHITECTURE IN TRANSITION: 
          A Southern African Case Study</h5>
        <p align="left">Franco Frescura</p>
        <h5>ABSTRACT</h5>
        <p>This paper is the result of Doctoral research conducted in the  Department of Architecture, University of the Witwatersrand,  between 1978 and 1985 and is a summary of its major findings.</p>
        <p>At its onset the programme set out to study the indigenous rural  dwelling forms of southern Africa since 1822.  It examined the physical, social and economic factors which gave rise to a  number of different regional styles of construction. It then traced the arrival  of white farmers, missionaries, traders and military to the subcontinent and  the resultant changes which occurred in local architectural patterns. These  developments were analysed in the context of potential white-black cross-cultural  pollination through the use of a number of historical and current case studies.  The conclusions were that although a number of alterations in the local built  environment could be attributed directly to the arrival of white immigrants to  the region, such changes were both manipulative and pragmatic. As such they  could not be defined as being of a cross-cultural nature. The study then  focused upon the region's larger settlement units which were defined and  analysed. As a result it was realised that indigenous homesteads are governed  by a cognitive and unspoken language which reflects the people's social  structures, inheritance hierarchies, spiritual beliefs and cosmological  attitudes. Such language appears to have remained little changed since 1822. It  was thus concluded that whilst the form of the southern African dwelling has  indeed undergone a number of important modifications since the last century,  these do not necessarily extend to the cultural core of the local rural built  environment.</p>
        <h5>INTRODUCTION</h5>
        <p>Vernacular, or folk architecture as it is sometimes referred to,  derives many of its forms, textures and aesthetics from its use of the found  material: the timber, stone, grass and clay quarried from its immediate  environment. In the past this has led many researchers into rationalising such  architecture in purely geographical and climatic terms. Forde stated that &quot;<em>The  tools, utensils, houses and indeed the greater part of the material equipment  ... will show a direct relation ... to the available resources</em>.&quot;  (Forde, 1948)</p>
        <p>Because these studies tended to focus largely upon examples drawn  from environmental extremes such as the Eskimo of North America or economic  sub-cultures such as the San of southern Africa  (Fitch and Branch, 1960), the conclusions they arrived at were somewhat limited  in scope and failed to find relevance in a wider variety of cultural contexts.</p>
        <p>The limitations of such an approach were exposed in the 1970's  with the publication of a series of multi-disciplinary studies which rejected  environmental predeterminism and laid greater emphasis upon factors of a social  and cultural nature (Oliver, 1968, 1971 and 1975). Amos Rapoport's seminal book  &quot;<em>House Form and Culture</em>&quot;, published in 1969, concluded that:</p>
        <p>&quot;<em>The decision as to what form the  house shall take is made on socio-cultural grounds - way of life, shared group  values, and &quot;ideal&quot; environment sought</em>.&quot; (Rapoport, 1969)</p>
        <p>and viewed materials and technology as peripheral modifying  factors. Despite the fact that these works recognised the regional aesthetics  of man's habitat, his dwelling forms, building textures and decorative motifs,  their tendency towards creating cultural stereotypes merely had the effect of  substituting a new set of predeterminisms for the old. Subsequent work by  Rapoport, influenced by theorists in other disciplines such as Levi-Strauss  (1968) and Hall (1959), has led him to explore the use of non-verbal  communication in man's built environment (Rapoport, 1982).</p>
        <p>In southern Africa the study of  vernacular architecture was, up to recent times, still heavily reliant upon  regional and environmental models which, regrettably, have also been given more  popular interpretation as cultural and ethnic stereotypes (Walton, 1956; De  Jager, 1964; Van Der Waal, 1977). Much of this research project has, over the  past nine years, been spent in examining the validity of such stereotypes in  our indigenous built environment, in both historical and contemporary contexts.  Its results stand in direct contradiction to most currently-held cultural  models for the sub-continent.</p>
        <h5>ENVIRONMENTAL  FACTORS AS PRE-DETERMINANTS OF FORM</h5>
        <p>It is possible to gain a general if limited understanding of  southern Africa's built environment through an  analysis involving various geographical and environmental factors. These  include the following:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Faunal  infestation</li>
          <li>Geographical  distribution</li>
          <li>Physical  environment</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The first involved primarily the distribution of timber-consuming  termites over the subcontinent. It was found that a measure of localised  architectural adaptation to such infestation, in the form of verandah  dwellings, had occurred in some areas, most notably the northern   Cape, Botswana  and the northern Transvaal. However the  distribution of wood-destroying insects did not coincide with any one particular  dwelling form or building technology (Coaton, 1949). The impact of this  component was therefore considered as being minimal.</p>
        <p>The second was based upon a popularly-held stereotype that the  predominant form of indigenous dwelling built along the eastern coastal  littoral was the grass beehive hut whilst that built in the interior plateau  was in the form of a cone on cylinder. This idea was propounded as early as  1805 when Lichtenstein observed that:</p>
        <p>&quot;<em>The great differences observable  between the two nations (Xhosa and Tswana), and which are chiefly to the  advantage of the latter, consist in the more durable construction of their  houses.</em>&quot; (Lichtenstein,  1812 and 1815).</p>
        <p>More recently other writers have also espoused the same idea  (Walton, 1956; Frescura, 1981) which may be found to have a measure of validity  in the most general of senses. However subsequent research based upon archival  and archaeological data (Frescura, 1985) has been able to show that  hemispherical grass dwellings have been common throughout the southern African  interior right up to the mid-nineteenth century (Illustration 1). From 1860  onwards this form began to be replaced by the cone on cylinder. The gradual  phasing out of the grass dome in our rural culture over the last six generations  should be attributed to diminishing building resources and the changing  economic circumstances of indigenous farmers as well as to evolving cultural  patterns.</p>
        <p>The last, based upon the availability of building materials and  prevailing climatic conditions, provided, of the three, the most logical and  comprehensive explanation of the indigenous built environment up to that point  in time. As a result it became possible to derive eight major if overlapping  regions of building technology, ranging from a grass savannah in the south to a  wooded bushveld to the north and from an arid semi-desert in the west to a  semi-tropical coastal belt to the east (Illustration 2). Despite this however  it was again found that the stereotypes thus derived were valid only in the  most general of cases. Also, when compared with previous historical case  studies for the same geographical regions, it was discovered that this  architecture did not remain constant but tended to evolve or change, often  within a couple of generations (Frescura, 1981).</p>
        <p>It became obvious at an early stage of this project, therefore,  that factors relating to the physical environment did not provide a constant  and reliable guideline to the vernacular architecture of the region. They gave  only partial answers to some questions on dwelling form and building technology  and failed to explain a number of serious discrepancies which became  increasingly evident in the model as this study progressed.</p>
        <h5>ECONOMIC  ACTIVITY AS A PRE-DETERMINANT OF FORM</h5>
        <p>This section of the study was based upon differences perceived to  exist between the respective economic activities of hunter-gatherers, migrant  pastoralists and sedentary pastoralist farmers of the southern African region  up to the mid-nineteenth century. Each appeared to have developed its own  distinct style of dwelling forms and building technologies and, to all intents  and purposes seemed to provide a partial description of the local built  environment. However it was soon found that, historically, the economic  boundaries between the three were not clear-cut. A group of hunter-gatherers  could gain cattle and become migrant pastoralists (Elphick, 1977); migrant  pastoralists were recorded in some regions to have settled down to a life of  sedentary farming (Peires, 1981); and pastoralist farmers were not necessarily  bound to a sedentary life and hunting/gathering provided important supplements  to their primary agricultural activities.</p>
        <p>Ultimately the indigenous rural communities of this country were  forced into a fully sedentary agrarian economy as a result of the dispossession  of black-owned farming land on the part of white immigrants that took place  during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Since 1925 the increasing  pressures of a local migrant labour system and a coercive participation in the  local capitalist cash economy have all but destroyed the rural peasant farmer  as a viable force in the economy of the region with attendant results upon the  architecture of his homesteads (Bundy, 1979).</p>
        <h5>DWELLING  FORM AS A MANIFESTATION OF CULTURE</h5>
        <p>Although there is no doubt that a process of acculturisation has  indeed occurred in southern Africa since the early 1800s between the indigenous  black and the immigrant white populations, the exact nature and extent of this  phenomenon must lie in some question. For one thing the major agents of  cultural change - the military, the missionary, the government agent and the  trader - all showed varying degrees of success in their efforts. The military,  for example, played a powerful role in the politics of the region but neither  sought nor exerted much influence beyond that point. The missionaries sought to  use methods of strong moral coercion based largely upon Victorian values which  in the long run bore them precious little fruit. The government agent, on the  other hand, imposed a monetary hut tax which was not considered by many to be  overly onerous and was easily accepted by the indigenous population, probably  because it fell within the bounds of government already established by their  own traditional leadership. Yet it was the need to send their young men into  urban centres to earn the money for this tax that brought indigenous culture  into contact with a capitalist cash and consumer economy and facilitated the  subsequent task of both traders and, to a lesser extent, missionaries. In a  general sense however all four agencies must be seen to be part of a larger  interactive process, each supporting and creating opportunities for the other  (Frescura, 1985).</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images/arch/san-matting-shelters.jpg" width="300" height="208" /><br />
          <span class="title style1">San matting shelters, recorded by Backhouse in 1839, have not been in common usage since c. the 1850s</span> </p>
        <p>When applied to the built environment however an analysis of this  process revealed some startling results.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>The  process of interaction between white and black in southern Africa  did not begin in 1652 as it is traditionally believed but at least one hundred  years earlier when the first of a number of unwilling immigrants were deposited  upon our eastern shores through the medium of shipwrecks. Many such survivors  attempted to reach their own people; some made it, some perished in the effort,  but a sizeable proportion stayed behind, took on local wives and often  prospered. Theal commented in 1927 that:<br />
          <em>&quot;As there must have been a good many  white men incorporated in this manner by the southern Bantu clans during the  sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the resemblances to European tales which  are observed occasionally in the folklore of these people can easily be  accounted for.&quot; </em>(Theal,  1927)<br />
          It is safe to assume that many of these  men would have been craftsmen, most particularly ship's carpenters, in their  own right, or humble men versed in their own folk building traditions back  home. Yet there is no evidence that any of them practiced such skills locally  and their influence upon the indigenous built environment appears to have been  imperceptible.</li>
          <li>Missionaries  set out to &quot;civilize&quot; indigenous society by opposing such  local practices as initiation, beer- drinking, ukulobola or child-price,  ancestral worship and teenage sexual mores which they referred to as  &quot;unspeakable abominations&quot; (Wilkinson, 1898: 357). Claiming that &quot;Without  doubt it is a far more costly thing to kill the (indigenous population) than to  Christianise them.&quot; (Warnek, 1888), they set about their work with a  will. Usually their &quot;holy&quot; mission also involved persuading  people to wear clothes, pay taxes and live in &quot;neat little cottages&quot;  (Warnek, 1888). However, with the exception of the people's sartorial habits,  they met with remarkably little success (Williams, 1959). All of the above  traditions survive through to the present day and the circular plan dwelling is  still the single most built dwelling form found throughout southern Africa (Frescura, 1981).<br />
          On the other hand it would appear that  changes to the local built environment began to manifest themselves from the  1860's onwards (Illustrations 3-6) as the result of:</li>
          <ol type="a">
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Migrant  workers entering urban areas where they came into contact with new building  forms, and were taught new technologies and the use of new materials, most  specifically corrugated iron and bricks (Cumming, 1880). There is evidence of  black craftsmen plying their building skills in the eastern Cape from as early as the 1850's  (Baines, 1961 and 1964)</li>
              <li>The  rural inhabitant, farmer and migrant worker alike, entering a cash economy  which made certain mass-produced artifacts, such as furniture, available to his  community. The missionary Duvoisin reported from Basutoland  in 1885 that:
                <p><em>&quot;Their first preoccupation was to  acquire the arms of the Europeans; after which they have progressively adopted  their dress, their agricultural implements, their household utensils. They have  gradually begun to replace the native hut with stone or brick cottages, which  offer a greater resemblance to European houses; finally they have begun to  imitate them in their habits and their mode of life.&quot;</em> (Germond, 1967)</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>The  establishment of major industrial areas in the southern African interior as the  result of the discovery of diamonds in the northern Cape during the 1860's and  gold in the Transvaal during the 1880's. This not only spread the practice of  migrant labour to the interior but made available to the indigenous builder,  for the first time, the use of corrugated iron sheeting, discarded from urban  and industrial sources (Shillington, 1985). The rural use of sun-dried or  &quot;green&quot; bricks also dates from this era and the term kimmerli  or &quot;kimberley&quot;  brick is still synonymous in the region with this building technology.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>The  establishment by missionaries of industrial training schools in many parts of  southern Africa from the 1870's onwards. These  gave, among others &quot;Instruction ... in stone and brick building,  carpentry, blacksmith work, wagon repairing, shoe making and saddlery.&quot; (  Paris Evangelical Missionary Society, c1913). The success of such institutions  stands in sharp contrast to the failure of missionary endeavours in the field  of proselytizing.</p>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </ol>
        </ol>
        <p>The adoption of European building forms and techniques should  therefore not be seen to be part of a process of culture transmission between  the two groups so much as a deliberate and pragmatic borrowing of the one from  the other. Square- plan dwellings have neither spread widely nor, in most  cases, have they supplanted their circular counterparts in rural areas. Rather  they have been incorporated into the rural building tradition, widening and  enriching its range of domestic forms. Their adoption occurred as a response to  the increasing use of western furnishings by the rural indigenous community  (Biermann, 1971) and not, as some would have it, as a blind borrowing for  borrowing's sake (Illustration 7).</p>
        <p>The true &quot;cultural&quot; impact of such adoptions however,  was only realised during the course of this project once a number of local and  outwardly conflicting case studies were analysed. These revealed that although  strong connotations of group identity could be and often were attached to  either dwelling form, building technology or decorative motif, enough examples,  both historical and current, existed to show that such factors could not  consistently be assigned values of &quot;cultural&quot; or &quot;ethnic&quot;  identity. It is true that they all contributed to the creation of regional and  group stereotypes but, much like the environmental and economic models derived  earlier, could not be relied upon to provide consistent and accurate  descriptions of the indigenous built environment.</p>
        <h5>THE  MATABELE: A CASE STUDY IN TRANSITION</h5>
        <p>A good case in point is that of the Kumalo, a small Nguni clan  originating from northern Zululand who, as the result of internal political  tensions within the Zulu kingdom, migrated into the Transvaal  in 1822 under the leadership of their chief, Mzilikazi. Although the group was  initially small, numbering an estimated 300 warriors with their families, they  were also armed and trained in the Zulu manner. They were thus easily able to  defeat and absorb a number of smaller clans who barred their march northwards.  They quickly earned for themselves a reputation as courageous and skilled  fighters as well as the name &quot;Ndebele&quot; or &quot;Matabele&quot;  as they were to call themselves later on. By the time they had settled in  Matabeleland, the western region of present-day Zimbabwe, in 1837, they numbered an  estimated 5000 warriors (Wilson and Thompson, 1975).</p>
        <p>During this brief fifteen year period Matabele society underwent  four major relocations, taking them through a number of distinct environmental  and climatic zones. Originating in 1822 from a grass-rich area of northern  Zululand, in 1823 they halted in the bushveld of the upper Oliphants river,  bordering upon the timber-rich Lowveld; 1825 saw them in the mixed  bushveld/grassveld region near present-day Pretoria; in 1832 they settled in  the semi-arid bushveld of the Marico valley; and in 1837 they finally made  their homes in the mopane veld of western Zimbabwe. Throughout this time and  right up to 1897, seventy five years later, they continued to build their  dwellings in the form of a hemispherical beehive dome, using the same  technology, domestic structures and settlement patterns as they had done  previously in northern Zululand. It was only  once their political ascendancy over the neighbouring Shona was broken in two  successive wars with the British settlers in 1893 and 1897, that they appear to  have abandoned their attachment to the beehive form in favour of the cone on  cylinder, a form better suited to the physical realities of their region  (Child, 1968).</p>
        <p>The case of the Matabele is interesting for a number of reasons.  For one, by the time they had reached the Marico river valley of the western Transvaal, in 1832, they had ceased to be predominantly  Nguni. It is true that they had been joined from time to time by other Nguni  refugees from Zululand, but these groups were generally small and the bulk of  their numerical expansion was owed to the various Sotho and Tswana tribes they  encountered in the Transvaal. The status of  these recruits varied. Some enjoyed the status of full allies; others were  conquered and their young women taken as concubines whilst their young men were  eventually incorporated into Matabele regiments as full warriors (Child, 1968).  Thus a large proportion of the Matabele population in the Transvaal  was not of Nguni origin, but rather came from rural backgrounds whose domestic  architecture did include the knowledge and occasional use of beehive-type  structures but was predominantly orientated towards the cone on cylinder.</p>
        <p>It would appear therefore that despite undergoing the trauma of  four major relocations within a relatively brief period of time, the Matabele  clung tenaciously to a dwelling form which was neither familiar to the majority  of them nor could it have been practical in the physical surrounds they moved  through. When we consider that the construction of their towns, described by  Collins in 1831 as &quot;<em>a large kraal - or rather city, ... a collection of  closely built houses two miles in length</em>&quot; (Baines, 1961 and 1964),  must have involved vast amounts of material resources, a large proportion of  which would have been carried on foot over some considerable distances, then it  will be realized that such an achievement required a large amount of  determination and an inordinate attachment to a perceived architectural  tradition.</p>
        <p>It becomes clear therefore that the Matabele's retention of an  architectural style, which lasted for nearly seventy-five years, runs counter  to all the dictates of practicality and common sense and cannot be explained in  simple environmental and social terms.</p>
        <p>The solution probably lies in the fact that, between 1822 and  1837, the Matabele deliberately sought to create for themselves an identity  based upon the Zulu model. They called themselves &quot;Zulu&quot;,  their warriors dressed and fought like the Zulu, Zulu was their predominant  language and their style of architecture, both in settlement form and dwelling  type, conformed to the Zulu model. Dress, of course could be copied; military  tactics learnt and emulated; Zulu is a dialect of Nguni, a language common to  the entire eastern littoral; but architecture, particularly settlement pattern,  is recognised by rural people to be a reflection of their entire cosmology,  their economic system, social structure, inheritance hierarchy and religious  practices and is thus their most manifest banner of group identity. It could be  for this reason, therefore, that the beehive dwelling form was adopted and  clung to so tenaciously for nearly four generations, seemingly against powerful  odds.</p>
        <p>The reason why a &quot;Zulu&quot; identity should have been  so carefully cultivated by the Kumalo is a little more difficult to establish.  At a superficial level it could be read to have been no more than a simple  psychological device which exploited the fearsome reputation enjoyed by Zulu  regiments under the leadership of Shaka. This may well have been possible but  such a theory ignores the fact that the Zulu leadership under both Shaka and  Dingane showed a preoccupation with the presence of a second and alternative  &quot;Zulu&quot; state on the highveld which bordered on paranoia.</p>
        <p>The answer therefore probably lies in the concept of a political  identity. The original Zulu clan was a small group whose number in 1816 can  hardly have exceeded two thousand persons. By 1819 a wider Zulu identity  encompassed most Nguni along the coastal belt from the Pongola in the north to  the Tukela in the south. Under these conditions the term &quot;Zulu&quot;  ceased to have connotations of clan and became identified with the political  ideal of a larger Zulu state. Thus when Mzilikazi fell out with Shaka,  ostensibly over the question of how to divide the spoils of a military victory,  what was at issue in reality was not the future of a herd of cattle but the  political leadership of this state. The establishment of an alternative &quot;Zulu&quot;  presence in the southern African interior was not simply the work of a petty  chief who had emigrated and was making good elsewhere, but it was perceived to  stand as a challenge to the very identity of a &quot;Zulu&quot; state.  It is not known whether the differences between Shaka and Mzilikazi were based  on a simple leadership struggle or upon more fundamental ideological issues. We  do know however that Shaka's Zulu kingdom was predominantly Nguni and hence of  a limited and regional nature. Mzilikazi's domain on the other hand encompassed  in its time Nguni, Sotho/Tswana and Shona alike. It is possible to postulate  therefore that, of the two men, it was Mzilikazi who was endowed with the wider  vision. It is not known whether this envisaged the establishment of a black  southern African state but his own power base was established on a broader  regional front than Shaka's and must therefore be perceived as a forerunner to  such an ideal.</p>
        <p>If this interpretation is indeed correct, then it might also explain  why the beehive dwelling form, so symbolic of their own group identity, was  abandoned after 1897 when Matabele political ascendancy in their region was  crushed by the white colonists of what was to become Southern   Rhodesia.</p>
        <h5>SETTLEMENT  FORM AS A MANIFESTATION OF CULTURE</h5>
        <p>The Matabele example is but one of a number of similar case  studies which arose in the Southern African context. All of them indicated that  neither dwelling form nor decorative motif were reliable indicators of group  identity and cultural values, both being open to pragmatic manipulation.  Consequently the emphasis of this project began to fall increasingly upon the  study of the use of space within the larger homestead grouping. Anthropologists  had realised some time ago that indigenous settlements in southern Africa were a reflection of the social hierarchies,  inheritance patterns and political structures of the societies concerned  (Junod, 1962; Monnig, 1967, and others). However certain material differences  existing between the settlement forms of one region and the next had led some  scholars into the belief that these were representative of more fundamental  schisms within rural society as a whole (Erasmus, 1975, and others). Such  beliefs, although never fully documented on a wider comparative basis, also  tended to be supportive of certain white social and political prejudices and  thus went largely unquestioned until comparatively recent times.</p>
        <p>The findings of this project stand in direct contradiction to most  if not all such preconceptions. They revealed that rural settlement patterns  are governed by a cognitive and unspoken language which involved not only the  social, political, economic, sexual, inheritance and religious values of the  people concerned but in many ways also acted as a mirror to their cosmological  beliefs as a whole. As such therefore it was concluded that the usage of space  within the settlement represented a more reliable guideline to cultural pattern  than any of the other models derived and tested to date. When applied to a wide  range of examples, it became evident that the southern African region is the  home to two major cultural groupings - the Venda,  a small minority inhabiting the northern reaches of the Transvaal and the  larger Nguni/Sotho/Tswana grouping, or virtually the remaining indigenous  population of southern Africa.</p>
        <p>A brief overview of the structural principles governing the  settlement patterns of these two groups makes for some interesting comparisons.</p>
        <p>The Nguni/Sotho/Tswana model (Illustration 8) follows a circular  form enclosing a central cattle byre surrounded by individual dwelling units  (as among the Nguni) or by various homesteads (as among the Sotho/Tswana). The  main entry is located at the lowest point of the settlement which, if possible,  faces towards the east or north-east. The dwelling of the Head Wife or Mother,  the Great Hut, which is also the accepted residence of the family head, is  sited on axis with the entrance at the opposite end of the circle. The  dwellings of second and subsequent wives are then placed alternatively on  either side of the Great Hut in descending order of importance. The imaginary  axis thus created serves to divide the extended family group of a polygamist  into Left and Right Hand houses, thus establishing a hierarchy between the  House of the Head Wife, who also bears the family heir, and the Second House  which acts as her support group. A similar axis is also perceived to exist  within each individual dwelling unit, dividing it into &quot;Male&quot;  and &quot;Female&quot; areas.</p>
        <p>The huts of children and of visitors are located in the sector of  the circle closest to the gates. Although the homestead as a whole comes under  the titular leadership of the family head, the various dwelling units fall  under the control of the individual wife concerned and, having no formal place  of his own, the husband is expected to reside with each wife in turn. Every  wife has her own separate cooking hut located behind the sleeping unit together  with her own granaries and food stores. However supplementary granaries which  fall under the control of the men are located in pits hidden inside the cattle  byre and are available, under certain contingencies, to the group as a whole.  The cattle byre is generally acknowledged to be an area of male activity and is  also associated with burial and the performance of religious rites.</p>
        <p>In contrast the typical Venda homestead (Illustration 9)  does not follow a circular pattern, the various dwelling units being laid to  follow the prevailing site contours. The cattle byre is not associated directly  with the settlement but is located to one side of it. Unlike the  Nguni/Sotho/Tswana model, Venda social hierarchies are governed by a concept of  &quot;front-and-back&quot; and &quot;top-and-bottom&quot; which  distinguishes between husband and wife or wives, parents and children, chief  and people. No formal concept of &quot;left and right&quot; was recorded  in the case of either Venda  settlements or of individual dwellings. The husband/father has his own separate  quarters to the rear of the homestead behind those of the wives and children.  Like the Nguni/Sotho/Tswana, each wife controls her own living and work space  but, in a polygamous marriage, she is expected to reside in her turn in the  husband's quarters for a specified length of time.</p>
        <p>The distribution of wives' quarters is governed by considerations  of common convenience and functionality and only the Head Wife's residence is  given recognition by virtue of the fact that the main entrance path will lead  to her work areas. Access to a Venda  homestead, as well as social etiquette, is governed by a dis-axiality of  approach which can best be described as a &quot;zig-zag&quot; path.  Burial and religious ritual are usually associated with an area to the rear of  the father's quarters.</p>
        <p>It should also be pointed out that some evidence does exist for  the fact that the KhoiSan, the migrant herders and hunter/gatherers who at one  stage populated the greater part of the Cape and southern OFS, may have  represented in the past a third distinct cultural grouping in their own right  (Illustration 10). Unfortunately it has not been possible to substantiate this  hypothesis through current field research.</p>
        <h5>CONCLUSIONS</h5>
        <p>When viewed in the larger context of culture transmission it was  realised that although a white presence in southern Africa  had indeed wrought some obvious changes to the local built environment, their  nature made it impossible to assign &quot;cultural&quot; values to them.  On the contrary it became clear that what alteration had occurred to local  architecture was due to a process of deliberate and pragmatic assimilation done  in the normal course of cultural growth and change.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, archival and current research in the field has  indicated that although rural settlement patterns have undergone some changes  over the past eight to ten generations, the basic language of homestead layout  has remained essentially unaltered. This was demonstrated on numerous occasions  in various parts of the country when informants were able to interpret the  spatial functions of settlements abandoned, in some instances, for over a  century. In view of the fact that settlement patterns are a direct reflection  of the social, economic, religious and political activities of rural man, it  was concluded that the basic value structures of southern African indigenous  architecture since 1822 have remained essentially unchanged from exposure to  outside influences.</p>
