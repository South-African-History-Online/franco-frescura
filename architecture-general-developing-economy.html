	    THE ROLE OF THE DESIGNER IN A DEVELOPING  ECONOMY</h5>
	  <p align="left">Franco Frescura</p>
	  <p>It is an accepted truism in South Africa today that our current  economic standing represents the strange conglomerate of a modern urbanised  infrastructure living cheek by jowl with the problems and realities of an  urbanising community. Its uniqueness is emphasised by the fact that, since the  1860s, such development has only been made possible by the collaboration of two  groups, the one contributing its land and labour resources, the other its  material wealth and technological know-how. This has led some people to  mistakenly equate economic development with the importation of Western  technology to the subcontinent. One of the last bastions of such thinking in  this country lies in the field of architectural and environmental design where,  it is claimed, the role of the professional is to &quot;educate&quot; those  less advantaged and &quot;inspire&quot; them to a &quot;better&quot; way of  life. Quite apart from the fact that such thinking is openly paternalistic and  racist-orientated, it is also fallacious for it ignores the fact that Western  technology has caused more problems than it has resolved, such as environmental  pollution, the over-exploitation of natural resources and the current worldwide  crisis of a diminishing ozone layer. It should also be borne in mind that few  technological solutions developed in either Europe or North America have found  direct application in an African context: most have either been derived locally  or amended to meet local conditions.</p>
	  <p>As a result the role of the designer and his or her relevance to  the needs, realities and aspirations of a future southern African society are  open to some debate. This is unfortunate for, once stripped of his professional  elitism, an architect has much to offer to the community as a whole. Let us  examine some of these potential strengths.</p>
	  <ol>
	    <li>The  Architect is an interpreter of our culture and a custodian of our historical  heritage. At a time when our rural communities, both black and white, are  undergoing drastic and often traumatic changes, many of their architectural  traditions, building customs and historical forms are being lost through  neglect, bigotry or simply a desire by the people concerned for an improved  quality of life. However, instead of replacing this with a faceless uniformity  brought about by current international styles and modern building techniques,  it is the task of the architect to preserve and, in most cases, reinterpret the  textures, patterns and forms so characteristic of the southern African  landscape. It is but a matter of time before the resurgent concern for our  predominantly (white) architectural heritage spreads to embrace the historical  buildings of all South Africans.</li>
	    <li>The  Architect is a facilitator. Being part artist, part engineer, part builder and  anthropologist, and sociologist, and businessman, he occupies a crucial and  pivotal role in the production process of a building project. He is the  organiser who brings and holds together the team which makes a structure  possible. However in the normal course of events the client body is usually  excluded from the production process to a greater or lesser degree. This, more  than any other reason, is why designers have become alienated from the  community as a whole. In view of the cooperative and consultative nature of  greater southern African society this appears to be the one area where  architects will have to explore new methods of communicating their ideas and  discussing their implications at a basic community level.</li>
	    <li>The  Architect is a manager of resources. This is probably his greatest asset - the  fact that he not only administers resources but is also legally liable for  their efficient distribution during the course of a project.</li>
	    </ol>
	  <p>In these terms it will be seen that a professional designer will  have much to offer a future southern African society and, given the  opportunity, may do much to promote its economic development, the efficient  management of resources and the creation of buildings which best reflect our  concerns, values and realities as a nation. The hallmarks of a future South  African architectural practice will be a concern for the environment, whether  it be natural, cultural or historical; an ability to work and consult at a  basic community level; a willingness to be guided by group decisions; a  rejection of architectural statements motivated by ego and self; and an  understanding of the social processes which bring about a built environment.  Such a designer shall also have the strength of character to be able to decline  briefs to erect buildings which serve the needs of one group to the detriment  of others or which glorify sectarian political aspirations.</p>
	  <h5>POSTSCRIPT</h5>
	  <p>This paper began as a talk to the Society of Designers in South Africa,  in Port Elizabeth  on 10 March 1986, on the subject of A Community of Designers - The Realities  and Processes of Design in a Developing Society. It was then commissioned  as an article for Black Enterprise. (FRESCURA, Franco. 1989. The Role of the  Designer in a Developing Country&quot;. BLACK ENTERPRISE, Vol 22, 1989. 52-53)</p>
	  <h5>CAPTIONS  TO PHOTOGRAPHS</h5>
	  <ol>
	  <ul>
	    <li>The  Strydom Monument,  in Pretoria,  perches uneasily on its pedestal, a symbol perhaps of this country's precarious  social and economic equilibrium.</li>
	    <li>Bisho,  the Ciskei's  new capital city, presents a pastiche of architectural post-modernist styles  which rise starkly out of a wind-swept and barren landscape.</li>
	    <li>Pretoria, perhaps more than any other South  African city, seems to specialise in irrelevance. This is a roadhouse whose  architectural humour, derived from effete American styles, succeeds only in  being heavy-handed.</li>
	    <li>Peter  Rich's shopping centre at Elim has received much (justifiable) coverage in the  architectural press. It is one of the few examples of buildings in South Africa  which are both pleasing and the result of a consultative process between the  client and the designer.</li>
