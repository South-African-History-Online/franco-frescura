        <h5 align="left">NATIONAL OR NATIONALIST?
          A  Critique of the National Monuments Council, 1936-1989</h5>
        Franco  Frescura
        <h5>PREAMBLE</h5>
        <p>The  first tentative steps towards the preservation of South Africa's cultural heritage  were taken in 1911 when the Bushmen Relics Protection Act was passed.  This legislation was aimed specifically at the protection of San rock art as  well as other archaeological artifacts. However an awareness that the  historical built environment was a valuable and non-renewable resource which  should also be protected took somewhat longer to develop. In spite of the  establishment of a Historical Monuments Commission (HMC) in 1923, existing  legislation could do little to safeguard buildings and other artifacts from  indiscriminate destruction. It was only in 1934 that the promulgation of the Natural  and Historical Monuments, Relics and Antiques Act  empowered the HMC to extend its protection to a wide range of artifacts,  buildings and natural environments. As a result the HMC was able to embark in  1936 upon a relatively modest programme of monument declaration. This was  continued with increasing vigour after 1969 when the HMC was replaced by the  National Monuments Council (NMC), a body whose powers have since been extended  by successive Acts of legislation promulgated in 1979, 1981 and 1988  respectively (NMC c1986). Up to 1988, a period of 54 years, 3581 buildings,  sites and objects had been brought under the umbrella protection of the NMC  (NMC 1988), an average of 66 proclamations per annum.</p>
        <p>The  work of the NMC has undoubtedly played a leading role in preventing the  demolition of many individual historical buildings as well as the education of  the general public on issues of environmental conservation. In more recent  years however, the policy of monumentalisation as a conservation strategy has  been subjected to increasing scrutiny (Frescura 1989, and others). There is a  rising awareness among many architects, for example, that the character and  charm of a built environment owes much to the use of a particular set of building  elements (Theron c1984, Herholdt and Frescura 1987). These are often ephemeral  and thus virtually impossible to preserve through the declaration of  monuments.&nbsp; Also a wholistic,  multi-disciplinary approach to architectural conservation dictates that buildings  be read in their wider context. This may make the process of monumentalisation  irrelevant unless accompanied by parallel adjustments at a social,  environmental or technological level.</p>
        <p>This  paper examines the rationale behind a policy of monumentalisation and the role  that local architects have played in its formulation. It surveys the work of  the HMC/NMC since 1936 and concludes by suggesting a series of measures aimed  at making the work of conservation bodies more meaningful in the context of a post-apartheid  South Africa.</p>
        <h5 align="left">MONUMENTALISATION:  THE FAILURE OF ARCHITECTS</h5>
        <p>A  comprehensive historiography of architectural histories over the past two  hundred years has still to be written, although a number of interesting books  on the subject have begun to appear in more recent times (Rykwert 1972). For  our purposes however we can begin to identify three broad trends of thought.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The  first and older tradition follows a linear and compartmentalized pattern of  thought, favouring the creation of stylistic and historical stereotypes based  upon aesthetic patterns. The failings of such thinking are self-evident and are  best represented by the &quot;monumental&quot; work of Bannister  Fletcher, in all its nineteen comparative editions. His writings focused upon  the outward forms of what Rapoport described in 1969 as a &quot;high design&quot;  tradition, embodying the monuments of man, the works of the rich, the powerful,  the idiosyncratic (Rapoport 1969).</li>
          <li>The  second propounds a view of history as a series of interacting synchronic flows  responsive to socio-economic and technological forces and therefore accepts  aesthetics as being but one of the significant features of an architecture.  This thinking has typified many of the architectural histories written since  the early 1970s and was probably initiated by the publication of Charles  Jencks' &quot;Modern Movements in Architecture&quot; in 1973.</li>
          <li>In  more recent years a third school of thought has begun to emerge as the result  of interaction with other disciplines such as anthropology, sociology and psychology.  It argues that the built environment is governed by a series of cognitive  codes, a language perhaps, which permits us to accept an object, picture or  building as a document to be read and interpreted. The aesthetics of built  form, material texture and decorative motif are now given equal place alongside  spatial hierarchies and the social pressures which they reflect. It is argued  therefore that an artifact cannot be fully comprehended unless read in its  correct social context (Alexander 1977, and others).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The  impact of such thinking upon the everyday practice of building is not easy to  assess. Certainly the rise in recent years of a Post Modernist style of  architectural expression seems to suggest that the writings of  post-structuralist philosophers such as Derrida and Foucault (Sturrock 1979)  have not gone unread. However the monumental and elitist quality of much of  this work raises the question whether architects have truly understood the  lessons that post-stucturalism has to offer, or whether the profession's rank  and file have not merely adopted it as yet another aesthetic promulgated  through the glossy journals. The implications of such attitudes in the field of  culture conservation are understandably serious.</p>
        <p>Architects, almost by definition and certainly by their  very nature, build monuments. They build monuments to their clients, to their  national heroes, to their kings, to their presidents, to their political  systems, to corporate society and to their own egos. They build monuments because  they are encouraged to do so from the very first moment they cross the  threshold of an architectural school; because professional journals publish  monumental work and sneer at anything smaller; because politicians and  financiers reward them richly; because society lionises its monument builders  and their power; and because, unlike other mortals, architects are given the  opportunity of achieving immortality through their work. It is not for nothing  that most architectural history books are littered with the monuments of  patriarchal men: the religious shrines, the corporate headquarters and the  homes of the rich and powerful.</p>
        <p>It  does not come as a surprise therefore that the programme for the conservation  of our historical architecture in South Africa has become involved  primarily with the declaration of national monuments. Not only have architects  always been influential in this movement but our society, indoctrinated by  generations of architectural historians, has come to equate monuments  with &quot;history&quot; and, more dangerously, with &quot;culture&quot;.  This is plainly wrong. Not only does this marginalise the role of the larger  community in the processes of history, but it also ignores their habitat, which  at the best of times, constitutes the major part of the built environment.</p>
        <p>There  are, of course, other reasons why South African society should have become so  concerned with the creation of architectural monuments. In cases where a small  elite controls political power it also controls the writing, and the rewriting,  of history. At a time when South    Africa's white minority finds its legitimacy  being challenged from a variety of sources, it is natural that it should seek  to reinforce its precarious claim to tenure by elevating examples of its  material culture to the status of monuments. Revel Fox perceived this in  1986 when he stated that:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>&quot;<em>To achieve true cultural representation, our  very history books will have to be rewritten. People, places and events with  special significance for the different groups in our society will have to be  identified ...</em>&quot; (Fox 1987)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>However,  like other architects of his generation, Fox is also bound by the concept of  celebrating history through monuments. He went on to claim that:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p> <em>&quot;...  there will be a need for new monuments to record the memories of past events</em>&quot;  (Fox 1987).</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This  does not mean to say that, given a different set of circumstances, the concerns  and reactions of the local Black community would differ radically from this  standpoint. A good example of this was given in 1981 by Dr Edison Zvobgo when  he was still Zimbabwe's  Minister of Local Government and Housing.&nbsp;  Giving evidence as an expert witness in a court case successfully  instituted to save Jameson House, in Harare,  from demolition, he stated that: </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>&quot;Nations who go about destroying their  own buildings are in danger of destroying their own heritage.</em>&quot; (Jackson 1989).</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>In  this case Zvobgo was motivated by more than mere aesthetic considerations. In  1896 some twenty-two Zimbabwean patriots, who had taken part in a national uprising  against the white settlers, were tried and sentenced in the High Court which  sat in Jameson House. Thus, although the Zimbabwean experience differs from the  South African on a number of significant points, the intent of their  conservation policy remains orientated towards the preservation and declaration  of individual buildings as monuments. As such then, its outcome is very similar  to our own.</p>
        <p>Thus,  what is in question here is not the concept of conservation, but the  manner in which this is enforced through a policy of declaring monuments.</p>
        <h5 align="left">THE  FAILURE OF THE BUREAUCRACY</h5>
        <p>South Africa's record since 1936 in the  declaration of national monuments does not appear to have ever been fully  assessed. Thus the objectives and terms of reference of the HMC, formulated in  the 1920s, and first applied in 1936, are still being implemented almost  unchanged in the 1990s by the NMC.</p>
        <p>A  survey of the HMC/NMC's records for the past 54 years makes for interesting  reading (NMC 1969-1989). During this time some 2183-odd buildings, environments  and objects have been declared. Using these as a data base it was possible to  arrive at a number of conclusions.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>The  bias of HMC/NMC declarations has been almost overwhelmingly orientated towards  the Cape, 75% of monuments being located in  this province (figure 1). The remaining are distributed between the other three  provinces, with the Orange Free State  containing less than 5%. It does not appear that a significant change of  emphasis took place after 1974 when Brian Bassett joined the NMC (figure 2).</li>
          <li>Since  1936 the number of national monuments has increased at an exponential curve  which exceeds the rise gradient of this country's GNP (figure 3). It is  interesting to note that, in the fifteen years between 1974 and 1989, three  times as many national monuments were declared as in the previous 38 years.  This is probably attributable to growing public interest in the local  historical built environment, although other factors of a political and  economic nature have also played a strong contributory role.</li>
          <li>Since  1936 the declaration of national monuments appears to have taken place in a  number of well-defined stages (figure 4). The establishment of the HMC in 1934  was followed by a brief flurry of activity which covered the years between 1936  and 1939. This abated substantially after 1940 when the Second World War and  the economic downturn which followed it gave national monuments relatively low  priority in the national budget. A small number of declarations were made  annually from 1950 onwards, but their quantity remained modest, averaging only  eleven per annum up to 1969. During this time the bronze plaques, which the  HMC/NMC places outside proclaimed buildings, cost &pound;13.10.0 (R27.00) apiece. This appears  to have been a factor which affected the implementation of HMC policy to a  great degree (Barrie Biermann, pers comm July 1989). From 1960, after South Africa  left the Commonwealth, up to 1969, when the National Monuments Council was  established, there was a gradual increase in the number of listings. In 1969  the number of annual declarations rose sharply almost every year until 1983  when the number of proclamations more than trebled. This year marks a high point in the  activities of the HMC/NMC and since then the number of proclamations has undergone  a gradual decrease until 1989 when the number of declarations returned to the  same levels experienced in the early 1970s.</li>
          <li>Omer-Cooper has postulated that apartheid went  through three historical stages of development (1987)
            <ul>
              <li type="disc"><em>Baasskap  Apartheid</em>, which  emerged in the 1930s with Afrikaner nationalism and was moulded by white  supremacist ideologies from Europe. However it  was only put forward as a formal political platform in 1948 by the Nationalist  Party under Malan. It probably reached its climax in 1961 with the  transformation of South    Africa into an Afrikaner-ruled republic,  although vestigial elements survive to the present day.</li>
              <li type="disc"><strong>Separate  Development</strong>, which  sought to give racism a veneer of political legitimacy by formalizing colonial  policies of land segregation and labour exploitation into an ideology of  providing the various racial groups with separate-but-equal facilities. This  began to break down after 1973 when changing social and political pressures  inside the country began to bring about significant alterations in the South  African economy.</li>
              <li type="disc"><strong>Multi-racial  co-option</strong>, which  coincides with rising ANC political and military activity inside the country,  widespread social unrest, increasing militarisation of white political  structures, military adventurism both without and within the country, and  attempts to impose increasingly repressive legislation and censorship as part  of a policy of &quot;Total Strategy&quot;. This stage effectively came  to an end in 1989.<br />
              During this time the work of the HMC and its successor,  the NMC may be seen to act as a broad reflection of these social patterns  (figure 5). Before 1960 the declaration of national monuments was relatively  low key, marked only by an initial spurt between 1936 and 1938 and another in  1950. The tempo picked up perceptibly after 1960, the year of Sharpeville and  the State of Emergency,  and showed a slow but marked upward trend over the next 15 years. This reached  a high point in 1975 following the independence  of Angola  and Mocambique and the breaking of the so-called Info Scandal. In 1976,  the year of the Soweto  student uprising, was relatively quiet for the NMC but the upward swing was  picked up again the following year when Steve Biko was murdered and eighteen  community organisations, including World newspaper, were banned. The  period from 1976 onward was marked by the establishment of Bantustans  as independent states, rising guerilla activity within the country and  increased popular protests. This also marks the high point in NMC activity, and between 1983 and  1987, the years of greatest governmental oppression in this country, the  Council created 826 monuments, 38% of the total number ever declared.  Significantly once the incidence of violence began to decrease in 1988, so then  the number of declarations show a marked decrease, reaching levels comparable  to those experienced in the late 1970s.<br />
              Although during the 1980s  popular resistance to white minority government was countrywide, much of this  struggle was focused upon the eastern    Cape, a region generally acknowledged to be the  heartland of ANC support. It is significant therefore that, when the number of  monuments declared annually in this region between 1983 and 1987 is deducted  from the national totals, the chart undergoes a dramatic transformation (figure  6). The all-time high of 1983 is reduced substantially while other totals,  although still inflated, appear to be more in accord with the national average  since 1978. Data indicates that in 1983 61% of monuments declared were located  in the eastern Cape,  whilst in 1987 this figure was 49%.<br />  
                <br />
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>The distribution of monuments among  various language and culture groups indicates that the work of the HMC/NMC has  generally focused upon the material culture of white Dutch settlers to this  country. 97% of all declared monuments reflect the values of the immigrant  white community whilst the remaining 3% represent the art, architecture and  artifacts of 84% of this country's Black population (figure 7). The majority of  these were archaeological sites or the location of San wall art, thereby  perpetuating white supremacist stereotypes of indigenous South Africans as a  group of rural and poorly educated peasants possessing little material culture  of any note. The full breakdown, in percentages, is as follows (figure 8):          
            <ul>
              <li> Dutch, including Voortrekker, Boer and Huguenot &hellip;&hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 33%<br />
                Afrikaner, 20th century &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 17%<br />
                English, including 1820 settler, colonial and Empire &hellip;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 37%<br />
                All other white settler &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10%<br />
                Black, including Indian, Malay, Slave and Griqua &hellip;&hellip;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;3%</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>The  work of the HMC/NMC has focused predominantly upon urban sites, which comprised  66% of all declarations, while only 17% were located in rural areas (figure 9).  9% of the total were also concerned with structures which could be considered  to have a modern or high technology component, the majority being bridges or an  assortment of mechanical artifacts. Examples where colonial architecture has  attempted to find an accommodation with local values and traditions have  largely been ignored. This is probably indicative of a mind-set which has not  progressed much beyond a settler mentality, seeking to emphasise immigrant  roots and to justify a white presence at the tip of an otherwise &quot;dark&quot;  continent. The marked lack of national monuments reflecting a more recent  architectural aesthetic, such as Modernism and Art Deco, seems to strengthen  this viewpoint. It also seems to indicate that the majority of officials  employed by the NMC originate predominantly from urban, white, bourgeois  backgrounds and have little in the way of inclination, knowledge or travel  budgets to venture beyond the city confines.</li>
          <li>Analysis also indicates that 43% of declared  national monuments originally fulfilled a domestic function, while 11% were of  a religious nature. The remainder served a wide variety of governmental,  industrial and public uses (figure 10).</li>
          <li>76% of all national monuments were declared  after 1974, when Brian Bassett joined the NMC. Understandably the concerns of  the HMC/NMC have not remained consistent over the years and, in some cases,  have shown extreme fluctuations. For example, all listed theatres and hotels  were declared after 1974 although no artistic artifacts have been listed since  that time. Similarly there has been a marked increase in the number of listed industrial  buildings and urban domestic structures, while there has been a considerable  drop in civic spaces, military installations, bridges, walls and natural  features (figure 11).<br />
            <br />
            As a  result of their enlightened work the HMC/NMC have managed to identify  and immortalise some prime examples of South Africa's cultural heritage.  These include the following architectural gems:        </li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
          <li>Hendrik  Verwoerd's residence at Betty's Bay, which was canonised in December 1973.  Known as Blaas 'n Bietjie, it is reputed to have been planned by its  owner in 1961.</li>
          <li>The  cornice and pediment of 131 Bree    Street, Cape Town,  proclaimed in 1950. This building was subsequently demolished in 1971, thereby  illustrating the effectiveness of conserving odd bits and pieces from a  structure.</li>
          <li>Two  houses, one in Cradock and the other in De Aar, which, at different times, were  the home of Olive Schreiner.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Among  the artifacts which the HMC/NMC has lovingly preserved for posterity we can  find nine pieces of artillery whose potential for demolition remains somewhat  suspect; a historic hyena trap, found on the farm Bluegum House, in  Graaff-Reinet; eighteen water pumps which, it is claimed, sum up the cultural  heritage of Jagersfontein; and the first manufactured aircraft engine in South  Africa, which is in the tender care of the Bloemfontein Museum.</p>
        <p>The  Monuments Council has also paid particular attention to the historic, and  rapidly vanishing craft of digging holes in the ground. The Aandenk  borehole, at Allanridge, in the Orange    Free State, is reputed to be a prime example of its  genre, whilst those wishing to fill in the railway tunnel at Waterval Boven  will find their way barred by an angry crowd of NMC officials.</p>
        <p>The  demands of horticultural historians and arboreal architects have also been well  catered for. Van Riebeeck's hedge, in the Kirstenbosch Botanical    Gardens, and remains of the same in Klaasen Road,  Bishopscourt, are both listed monuments. Lovers of leafy lushness and luxuriant  lumber can also visit an orange tree on the farm Groot Heksrivier, in  Citrusdal, a fig-tree on a vacant lot in Church Street, Durban,  and an acacia tree in Pietermaritzburg. They can also mourn over one syringa  tree stump in Rustenburg, which is reputed to have provided the rump of some  sainted volk hero with a temporary resting place.</p>
        <p>An  interesting item which also features in the NMC's listings is the engraved  names of Slotsbo, Rhenius and Bergh, at Vanrhynsdorp, which only goes to show  that today's vandalism is tomorrow's national monument.</p>
        <p>Quite  clearly therefore HMC/NMC policy since 1936 has been concerned predominantly  with white, Dutch and Afrikaner domestic structures mostly located in the Cape Province.  Significantly the number of declarations affecting the material culture of  rural Afrikaners is particularly low. However a glimpse of Government policy  since 1948, which used urbanisation as a means of reducing levels of rural  white poverty, reveals that this lack is probably owed to a wish to submerge,  or even falsify, the historical record.</p>
        <p>It is also obvious that the policy of monumentalising our  built environment has been used, consciously or unconsciously, to reinforce  white political strategies and to support claims of white legitimacy in the  region. This took place at a time when indigenous Black groups, wishing to cast  off the burden of political and economic repression, were challenging this  ideology. In 1982 the South African Post Office issued a set of postage stamps  featuring 26 buildings from the colonial era. Significantly all were listed  monuments, and ranged from Cape Town Castle, begun in 1652, through to the Union Buildings  in Pretoria,  finished in 1912, a period of 250 years. Although the designs were outwardly  value free, both from a graphic and a philatelic point of view, their social  context gave them a clear political focus. They could be interpreted as  statements proclaiming that South    Africa was an outpost of Western European  civilization, while at the same time giving legitimacy to a White colonial  presence whose work and ingenuity was evident through its visible and concrete  monuments. The intent of this issue was summed up in its publicity booklet,  which asserted that:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>&ldquo;<em>The establishment of Western European civilization at  the southern tip of Africa towards the middle of the seventeenth century was  the prelude that would in time to come give a new turn to the course of events  in this part of the continent &hellip; Although &hellip; this culture was never completely  isolated from Western Europe, it is also evident that it had a clearly  indigenous character</em>&rdquo;.  (SAPO, 1982)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The use of key words, such as &ldquo;<em>Western European  civilization</em>&rdquo;, &ldquo;culture&rdquo; and &ldquo;indigenous character&rdquo; are clear  markers to the ideology represented by such statements. In the mind-set of  Apartheid ideologues the passage of time had allowed Whites to lay claim to indigenous  status, while the creation of large-scale civic works presented tangible proof  of their civilizing influence, their permanence, and their commitment  to the country. At the same time it ignored the reality of the wholesale  dispossession of rural land that had taken place in this country as recently as  the 1970s, and reinforced conservative White claims to its control of  productive agricultural areas. This stands in sharp contrast to the symbolism  used on the Union coat-of-arms, designed in 1910, a scant 70 years previously,  where an ox-wagon, representing the Transvaal,  was used to represent immigration. As recently as 1949, a stamp issue  celebrating the unveiling of the Voortrekker Memorial, depicted an ox-wagon,  and proclaimed Voortrekkers as &ldquo;heroes and heroines of our European  civilization&rdquo;.

        <p>The  relationship between the HMC/NMC and ruling political ideology also needs to be  examined. Since 1969 about 71 people have been nominated to the NMC Council. Of  these 54 have been Afrikaans speaking, only three have been women and two have  originated from outside the white community. At least 12 are known members of  the Broederbond, the secret society of Afrikaners which, since 1919, has sought  to regulate South Africa's  political, economic and cultural life. These included FD Conradie, Member of  Parliament for Oranjezicht, membership number 4765; Prof JJ Oberholster,  membership number 4444, who was a member of the Council from 1951 to 1976 and  in 1977 became its first Executive Director; Dr WA Cruywagen, former Minister  of Education; and H Sloet, Director of FAK (Wilkins and Strydom 1978). The  latter two were still sitting members of the NMC Council in 1990. (Appendix A)</p>
        <h5 align="left">THE ROLE  OF THE NMC IN A POST APARTHEID SOUTH    AFRICA</h5>
        <p>Apart  from the more obvious ideological role played by the NMC in giving legitimacy  to past totalitarian and racist regimes, the Council's policy of monument  creation should also be questioned on more fundamental and practical grounds.  It is true that the creation of a small number of monuments within an  urban environment can act as a focus for the restoration of smaller and less  important historical buildings, probably through the intervention of private  enterprise. It is equally true, however, that giving official historical  status to individual buildings may, at the same time, de-recognise  others about them, giving the impression that they are somehow less worthy of  recognition and thus leaving them vulnerable to indiscriminate demolition and  redevelopment. This is because current conservation policies single out special  cases, idiosyncratic examples or buildings of exceptional merit, and, through  the process of monumentalisation, isolate them from their social  context.</p>
        <p>This  means that the larger matrix of historical buildings and building elements is  generally ignored. This is incorrect, for such an attitude does not take into  account the reasons why such built environments should be preserved. This  extends beyond mere aesthetics, or associations with prominent persons and  events, and begins to explain the nature of historical habitats. These  environments have a scale which includes such varied elements as width of  streets, height of buildings, material textures and a clearly defined and identifiable  language of architecture. We feel secure in such surrounds, secure in our  knowledge of place, time and self-identity. This is why South African tourists  go to such extraordinary trouble to visit Pietermaritzburg, Pilgrim's Rest and  Stellenbosch or, alternatively, why so few people choose to holiday in Welkom,  Venterspost or Carletonville. In 1985 the citizens of Uitenhage, a small town  in the eastern Cape, invited the Department of  Architecture at the University   of Port Elizabeth to  conduct a survey of its historical architecture. There they found that although  the place was endowed with a number of fine and well preserved civic  structures, few historical buildings of a more humble domestic nature remained  intact. Out of a total of 1983 buildings in Uitenhage's historical centre, only  3.1% were of interest to the conservation study. This compared poorly with  other towns in the region such as King William's Town where the equivalent  figure was 8.7%, and Uniondale where this was 18%. Even Oudtshoorn, which has  undergone extensive redevelopment of its historical core in recent times, could  boast a higher figure of 6.9%. It was estimated that, at the present rate of  destruction, only a scattering of Uitenhage's historical heritage would survive  to see the town's bi-centennial in 2004.</p>
        <p>However,  researchers from the University   of Port Elizabeth also  found that much of the town's architectural charm and historical character  could be attributed to a variety of applied elements: timber sash windows,  decorated roof fascias, cast iron ridge pieces, verandahs with cast iron or  fretted timber trims, and ornamental roof ventilators. Certainly none of these  items, taken individually, warranted the status of a declared &quot;national  monument&quot;. Yet the larger impact of the town was not owed to its civic  buildings so much as to the textures of its domestic architecture and the  modest scale of its well-wooded streets. Sadly, much of this heritage is being  lost daily through a combination of ignorance, lack of maintenance or merely a  desire for innovation for its own sake. This is a story which is being repeated  daily throughout southern Africa's smaller  towns and villages.</p>
        <p>Perhaps  then what is required is a new set of attitudes in our conservation policies.  Whites are perceived by fellow South Africans to have a throw away attitude  towards their spouses, their children and their parents while spending  extraordinary sums on the preservation of old buildings, dusty books and rare  artifacts. If national monuments are truly needed, then by all means, let us  have national monuments, but let us use them as part of a larger policy towards  the urban landscape. As things stand, monuments are proclaimed in isolation of  the contribution they make to urban life. When Dr Nic Woolff conducted his  restoration of the Donkin row-houses in Port    Elizabeth, these were declared national monuments and,  in due course, his work received a number of conservation awards. His citations  make reference to the careful workmanship, to the exact recreation of details  and to the landmark value of the structures. Not once has it been mentioned  that the buildings create a corridor which not only links the city's business  district to the historical residential core but, in doing so, they reinforce  the conservation efforts of others in the area, incorporating them into a  larger and more cohesive whole. This then is where the merit of creating  monuments truly lies: to reinforce existing historical fabrics; to re-integrate  old buildings into the present-day life and activities of the community; to  return them from structural decay and the threshold of demolition; to serve as  focal points for further development; to put a halt to a potential &quot;domino  effect&quot;, where the loss of one important building puts a series of others  under the immediate threat of removal. Such buildings, in their turn, reward  the community and enhance the architectural character of its habitat, creating  an exciting stage-set for the daily lives of their residents. We must also  recognise that urban redevelopment is subject to market forces which determine  where opportunities for new economic growth may exist or arise. Thus a  conservation policy which sets out to create a number of museums, sterile and  devoid of life, must fail because this stifles the economic development of a  town. On the other hand, a policy which creates opportunities for growth, also  generates new environments. These are valuable assets which contribute to the  welfare of all citizens.</p>
        <p>Ultimately  however, when we discuss a &quot;conservation policy&quot; in its wider  sense, we are not talking about monuments, but are seeking to maintain and  restore the character of a built environment and retain a worthwhile quality of  life for its inhabitants. The words of Jean Cassou, written in 1968, stand as a  clear warning against a conservation policy guided by the narrow concerns of  sectarian &quot;culture&quot;. He said &quot;<em>The only obligation that  this 'culture' imposes on us is to preserve the testimonies of the past, and  perhaps even more to preserve the opportunity they provide for  self-glorification.</em>&quot; (Cassou 1968)</p>
        <p>Much  as patriotism is claimed to have become the last refuge of the scoundrel, we  must not allow culture and the monuments of culture to become the  last bastions of the bigot. </p>
