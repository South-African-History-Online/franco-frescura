		<p><strong>FRANCO FRESCURA</strong></p>
	    <p><strong>Abridged Biography</strong></p>
	    <p>Franco Frescura was born in  Trieste, Italy, in 1946 and nine years later his family emigrated to South  Africa. He entered the Faculty of Architecture at the University of the  Witwatersrand in 1966 where, following a chequered undergraduate career, he  obtained his BArch in 1977. In 1979 Prof Pancho Guedes appointed him to the  teaching staff at Wits, and in 1980 he began to read towards an MArch. This was  granted cum laude in 1981, and was followed by a PhD in 1986. Between  1976 and 1989 he documented the self-built architecture of indigenous  communities living in rural South Africa, and his first book on the subject, Rural  Shelter, was published by Ravan Press in 1981. Since 1978 he has published  over 171 books and articles, 21 of which have appeared in peer-reviewed  publications. Frescura has also lectured at the University of Port Elizabeth,  and more recently was appointed to the Chair of Architecture at the University  of KwaZulu-Natal. He is currently Senior Research Associate in Culture,  Communication and Media Studies at the same institution. He has sat on a number  of policy-making bodies, both national and regional, and from 1994&ndash;1999 he was  Head of the Philatelic Section of the South African Post Office, where he directed  the design and symbolic imagery of the nation&rsquo;s stamps.</p>
