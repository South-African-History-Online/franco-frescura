        <h5>THE DEVELOPMENT OF A CONSERVATION STRATEGY 
          FOR SMALL URBAN CENTRES IN THE EASTERN CAPE</h5>
        <p>Franco Frescura</p>
        <h5>INTRODUCTION</h5>
        <p>In recent years the conservation of man's built environment has  become a major social and political issue, not only in South Africa,  but throughout the western world. Many people and communities have come to  realise that the quality of life offered by older buildings often exceeds that  provided by modern architecture and technology; that the textures and patterns  of old environments give society a sense of context and continuity; that such  areas are not only economically viable but often tend to generate a wide range  of conservation-oriented activities; that architecture is one of the major  criteria used by man to judge the cultural achievements of a region; and that,  in a cultural sense, a people without a past is a people without a future.  Under these circumstances it is easy to understand how the concept of  conservation could have become deeply enmeshed with emotion and nostalgia leading  some conservation-minded individuals to develop what can best be described as a  knee-jerk reactionism to matters new.</p>
        <p>The eastern Cape  is an area rich in architectural heritage. It is also economically  under-developed, a condition which has persisted since its colonialisation in  the 1820's. Therefore, when this project was begun in 1985 at the University of  Port Elizabeth, it was in the knowledge that the region's cultural mix,  economic realities, colonial inheritance and growing rural poverty necessitated  an attitude towards conservation which went beyond a mere romantic attachment  to old artifacts. In order to survive the uncertainties of this country's  social and economic future, our built environment needs to be assessed  according to a pragmatic value system based upon the region's needs. Ultimately  it is believed that the retention and restoration of historical structures can  lead to the creation of jobs in the formal and informal sectors and the  generation of new incomes in such industries as tourism, new building  construction and old building maintenance. Conservation should therefore be  viewed as a potential development industry in a country which, in many ways,  still has a developing or third world economy.</p>
        <p>It was also believed that, although a number of noteworthy  conservation and restoration projects have been completed in southern Africa to date, these have usually involved single  buildings. With few exceptions such structures belong to what Amos Rapoport has  called the &quot;grand design tradition&quot;: the monuments, the civic  buildings and the homes of the rich, the powerful and the idiosyncratic (1969).  Thus local conservation efforts to date have generally tended to ignore the  larger body of humble domestic architecture which does not necessarily stand  out individually but creates the contextural backdrop essential to a larger  historic environment. The character of such architecture is usually based upon  applied elements : cast-iron trims, verandahs, fretted timber fascias, finials,  loft ventilators and sash timber windows - elements which are being lost daily  through neglect or just plain ignorance and cannot be preserved through the  continued declaration of national monuments. Therefore no matter how many  individual buildings may find careful and loving restoration, their impact will  be minimal unless conservation is also tackled on a wider, urban scale. Such an  approach allows decision makers and city fathers to approach the subject with a  detailed knowledge and awareness of their town's historical potential and it  enables them to exercise control over a wide range of planning and land usage  options. There appears to be little use for conservation if, as in the case of  Uitenhage, a petrol station is allowed to be built next door to a potential  national monument (Herholdt and Frescura, 1986).</p>
        <h5>RESEARCH  OBJECTIVES</h5>
        <p>This project is based upon work conducted in the eastern Cape region by members of staff of  the Department of Architecture at UPE from 1983 to date. It includes research  done in such centres as Uniondale, Oudtshoorn, Keiskammahoek, Bathurst, King  William's Town (Project leader Franco Frescura), Uitenhage (Project leaders  Albrecht Herholdt and Franco Frescura), Enon, Aberdeen, Steytlerville (Project  leader Albrecht Herholdt), Knysna and Cape St Francis (Project leader Danie  Theron). It is orientated towards the development of a research methodology  which will enable concerned individuals, conservation agencies and local  municipalities to conduct an evaluation of their own historical built environments  without necessarily resorting to the services of a small and already  over-engaged group of conservation experts. Such guidelines will enable local  groups to develop a conservation strategy valid to their own individual  contexts without having the values or prejudices of an outside researcher being  imposed upon them.</p>
        <p>Although the documentation published thus far represents a wide  range of projects, these should be read as one. Not only do they employ a  common methodology derived as the result of consultation between researchers  but, in most instances, each successive case explores new areas of the  theoretical framework.</p>
        <p>It is relevant to note that although the work currently suffers  from a noticeable Eurocentric emphasis, it is hoped that this bias is of a  temporary nature.&nbsp; In future it is  planned to extend the scope of this work to cover the full range of communities  and cultures found in the eastern    Cape (Frescura 1987a).</p>
        <h5>RESEARCH  METHODOLOGY</h5>
        <p>The first step in such a research programme usually involves a  detailed examination of the historical architecture of the urban environment in  question. Normally this will entail the listing of buildings deemed to be  conservation-worthy according to a number of predetermined criteria. Although  this stage is crucial to subsequent conservational action, to date no more than  a score of towns in southern Africa are  believed to have conducted such an exercise. Unavoidably the methodology used  to date has varied considerably from study to study and from one individual  researcher to the next. Findings have thus tended to suffer from a general lack  of consistency.</p>
        <p>Although the listing of a town's buildings is an important weapon  in the arsenal of a conservation body, it is of little value unless it is also  followed up by subsequent and more detailed research. Bearing this in mind, a  methodology has been evolved based on the following stages of work:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Stage 1. A preliminary windscreen survey of the  town. This establishes basic findings and creates a framework for subsequent  more detailed research.<br />
            Stage 2. A detailed sidewalk survey during which  buildings are evaluated according to age, condition, quality of architecture,  function and location. This usually forms the basis for a preliminary report.  Where necessary important structures and textures are recorded by means of  measured drawings or freehand sketches.<br />
            Stage 3. Through the cooperation of the town's  archivist, historian or museum curator, an amended sector theory model is used  to recreate the historical development of the town.<br />
            Stage 4. At the same time a register of the  town's major structures known to have been demolished since 1910 is established  together with details regarding their location, former owners and reasons for  demolition.<br />
            Stage 5. Finally the names of the present owners  of historically important buildings is incorporated into the survey data.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This information allows for the creation of a number of charts,  maps and mathematical models which reveal, among other things, the following  data:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The  character and extent of the town's historical core and fabric of current urban  land use.</li>
          <li>The  spread and distribution of the town's surviving historical heritage.</li>
          <li>The  location of development nodes and future demolition trends.</li>
          <li>Identifies  individual buildings or town blocks under threat of redevelopment and gives  early warning of the formation of land cartels.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Taken as a whole this information allows the researcher to  establish not only those areas where conservation should be encouraged as a  whole but also to determine the threat factor faced by individual buildings.  For example current research has shown that a structure owned by either local  authority or a major business concern is under higher threat of demolition than  one owned by a private individual. Such considerations are also influenced  significantly by site location and land values.</p>
        <h5>EDUCATIONAL  STRATEGIES</h5>
        <p>Apart from the more obvious elements of contact and feedback  between researcher and community concerned, this programme is currently engaged  in the preparation and dissemination of three main publications:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A  handbook on conservation research and methodology aimed at lay groups and local  municipalities. This will set out basic conservation strategies and survey  methods as well as give guidelines as to the interpretation of survey data. The  volume is currently under preparation and is expected to go to print within  this year.</li>
          <li>A  bilingual glossary of conservational terminology aimed at providing the lay  public with a basic nomenclature covering most aspects of this country's  indigenous, folk and colonial architectures. The first edition of this work has  been completed and is currently awaiting publication (Frescura, 1987b).</li>
          <li>A  hand-book which examines the elements, styles and chronological datings of  buildings in southern Africa from the 1840's  to 1910. Aimed at both layman and architectural researcher, this will provide a  basic outline of the region's architectural typology and give guidelines for  the description, analysis and dating of the region's historical buildings. This  volume is currently being researched and should be ready for publication by  early 1990.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It goes without saying that the results of the various  architectural surveys should also be made available for public consumption. To  this end reports on Keiskammahoek, Uitenhage, Oudtshoorn, Uniondale  and Steytlerville have already been published. Preliminary reports have also  appeared on King William's Town and Aberdeen.</p>
        <p>It should also be borne in mind that the implementation of a  conservation study in a small urban area is usually dependant upon a concurrent  programme of information dissemination and smaller awareness-generating  projects aimed at both the town's citizens and its decision makers. It is true  that the concept of educating for architectural conservation is vast and thus  beyond the scope of any single regional programme such as this one. However,  through the selective use of data culled from the survey document, it is  possible to devise any number of minor architecturally-related projects which  are both simple and effective to implement.</p>
        <h5>IMPLEMENTATION  OF FINDINGS</h5>
        <p>The final stage of a conservation study, the implementation of  findings, should be seen as a long term multi-faceted component which may take  a number of years to complete. This is an area where local groups and  municipalities come into their own and allows them the opportunity of  implementing conservational programmes tailored to their own needs, realities  and expectations. One such programme is currently taking place in Uitenhage  where many of the conservational proposals put forward as a result of the  Frescura/Herholdt study are now being implemented by the local municipality.</p>
        <h5>CONCLUSIONS</h5>
        <p>The  conservational philosophy of the Department may be summarised as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A  conservation policy does not set out to create a large number of museums nor a  whole museum town. It rather seeks to maintain and restore the character of a  built environment and retain a worthwhile quality of life for its inhabitants.</li>
          <li>It  does not concern itself only with individual buildings but seeks to look at the  environment as a whole. There does not appear to be much sense in restoring a  national monument only to site a factory next door to it later on.</li>
          <li>It  seeks to revalidate old buildings, giving them new relevance in line with  current economic needs and realities.</li>
          <li>It  does not necessarily mean restoring the building back to either its original  function or its original form.</li>
          <li>It  does not mean creating something that was never there and passing it off as the  original and genuine article.</li>
          <li>A  conservation policy does set out to create economic development in a variety of  ways</li>
          <li>such  as making work opportunities in times of economic depression.</li>
          <li>such  as the recycling of old buildings at a fraction of the cost of new ones.</li>
          <li>such  as encouraging peripheral economic activities as tourism and small businesses  based upon conservation work.</li>
          <li>A  conservation policy does set out to preserve and present the culture and values  of a place, region or people, thereby allowing them to derive pride in their  own achievements.</li>
        </ul>
