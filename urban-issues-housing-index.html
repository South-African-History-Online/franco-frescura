	    Housing issues</h5>

	  <p>Much of the discussion which has surrounded the field of housing  in this country since 1976 has focused upon the failure of the architectural  profession as a whole to invest its not inconsiderable design talents in the  resolution of this problem. Although some of the blame may be laid at the door  of central government and local authorities who, up to recent times  consistently refused to commission architects in this work (Lazenby, 1977), the  profession also stands indicted in that it has failed to develop the necessary  grass-root and community-orientated skills necessary to large-scale housing  work. Thus, in spite of the efforts of such individuals as Noero in the  Transvaal and Haarhoff and Harber in Natal,  much of the architectural research being conducted in low-cost habitat has  remained almost exclusively the province of the NBRI and a small band of  concerned academics within the universities.</p>
	  <p>Part of the problem has undoubtedly lain in the economic realities  of housing and many an architectural practice, in the past, has found its  ardour for social reform cooled by the meagre returns available for its  efforts. However, some housing projects conducted by architects in more recent  times have shown even greater failings than was previously anticipated. One  need look no further than the post-modernist confections served up by designers  in the Ciskei (Frescura and Volpe, 1988) and Bophuthatswana (Gallagher Arup  Samson Inc, 1987) to realise their authors' eurocentric values and ignorance of  things African.</p>
	  <p>The failure of these projects lies not so much in the fact that  the architects concerned have tended to use local decoration as a pastiche  layering to hide their simplistic efforts as in their inability to grasp the  essential nature of such aesthetics. Indeed the simple activity of wall  painting is associated in rural life with the fertility, group identity and  political rights of women (Frescura, 1985). The absurdity of translating such  symbolism to an urban habitat is therefore self-evident. It is not for nothing  that, during the social unrest of 1976, the students of Ngoya, Zululand, and Turfloop, Pietersburg, targeted for arson  those buildings which the architects, in their wisdom, had endowed with rural  decorative motifs, the library, the student's union and the administration  block, which were seen as symbols of white domination and ideological  repression. Such rejection of rural aesthetics by an urban black clientele  should not be seen as a breaking of historical links between the two  communities so much as a forceful denial of the cultural and political  stereotypes created by whites as a tool of their political expediency.  Therefore architectural efforts to achieve some kind of post-modernist regional  aesthetic based upon rural motifs must also be seen to promulgate visually the  same racial bigotry which has blighted South African society since 1948.</p>
