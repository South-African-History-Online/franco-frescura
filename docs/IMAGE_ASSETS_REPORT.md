```
hugo-site/static/
├── images/              # 86 total files
│   ├── *.jpg/gif       # 7 files in root
│   ├── arch/           # 14 architecture-related images

## Image Reference Breakdown

| Directory | Count | Usage |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| `/images/` | 7 | Homepage, section icons |
| `/images/arch/` | 7 | Architecture articles |
| `/images/burger-saga/` | 43 | John Burger Saga series |
| `/images/keis/` | 2 | Historical documentation |
| `/graphics/` | 1 | Site graphics/banners |

## Image Reference Format

All image references in markdown files use the correct format:

```markdown
![alt-text](/images/filename.jpg)
![alt-text](/images/subdirectory/filename.jpg)
![alt-text](/graphics/filename.jpg)
```

Examples from actual content:
- `![portrait-FF](/images/portrait-FF.jpg)` - Franco's portrait
- `![sa-arch](/images/arch/sa-arch.jpg)` - Architecture images
- `![burger-01](/images/burger-saga/burger-01.jpg)` - Graphic work

---

## Migration Process

### 1. Initial Migration
The `migrate_content.py` script copied all images from the root to `hugo-site/static/`:
- Copied `images/` → `hugo-site/static/images/`
- Copied `graphics/` → `hugo-site/static/graphics/`
- Preserved subdirectory structure

### 2. Reference Fixing
The `fix_image_refs.py` script fixed broken image references:
- Converted `![\1](/\2filename.jpg)` → `![alt](/images/filename.jpg)`
- Handled subdirectories correctly
- Matched filenames across all subdirectories

### 3. Verification
The `verify_images.py` script confirmed:
- All 60 unique images exist
- All paths are correct
- No missing files

---

## Accessibility Testing

Sample images tested via HTTP:
- ✅ http://localhost:1313/images/franco-1987.jpg → 200 OK
- ✅ http://localhost:1313/images/arch/sa-arch.jpg → 200 OK
- ✅ http://localhost:1313/images/arch/housing4.jpg → 200 OK
- ✅ http://localhost:1313/graphics/franco-1987.jpg → 200 OK

All images are served correctly by Hugo's static file handler.

## Maintenance

### Adding New Images

To add new images to the Hugo site:

1. **Place image in correct directory:**
   ```bash
   cp newimage.jpg hugo-site/static/images/
   # or for architecture images:
   cp newimage.jpg hugo-site/static/images/arch/
   ```

2. **Reference in markdown:**
   ```markdown
   ![Description](/images/newimage.jpg)
   # or:
   ![Description](/images/arch/newimage.jpg)
   ```

3. **Verify:**
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/verify_images.py
   ```

### Re-running Verification

At any time, verify all images:
```bash
# Verify all image references
python3 scripts/verify_images.py

# Fix any broken references (if needed)
python3 scripts/fix_image_refs.py
```

---

## Important Notes

1. **Duplicate Images**: Images exist in both `legacy-site/images/` and `hugo-site/static/images/`. This is intentional:
   - Legacy site needs its own copy for the HTML version
   - Hugo site needs its own copy in the static directory
   - Each site is self-contained

2. **Subdirectories**: The script correctly handles subdirectories like `arch/`, `burger-saga/`, and `keis/`

3. **Path Format**: All image paths in markdown must start with `/` to be absolute from the site root

4. **Static Files**: Hugo serves everything in `static/` at the root URL path
   - `static/images/photo.jpg` → `/images/photo.jpg`
   - `static/graphics/banner.gif` → `/graphics/banner.gif`

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

1. **Image Optimization**
   - Convert to WebP format for better compression
   - Generate responsive image sizes
   - Add lazy loading attributes

2. **Alt Text Enhancement**
   - Review and improve alt text for accessibility
   - Add descriptive captions where appropriate

3. **Image Galleries**
   - Create Hugo shortcode for image galleries
   - Add lightbox functionality
   - Group related images together

4. **CDN Integration**
   - Consider serving images from a CDN for faster global access
   - Implement image optimization service
