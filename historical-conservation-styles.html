    <h5 align="left">STYLES OF SOUTHERN AFRICAN ARCHITECTURE</h5>
    <p align="left">Franco Frescura</p>
    <h5>INTRODUCTION</h5>
    <p>The southern African sub-continent is the home of a rich and  varied architectural tradition. Not only does this include a wide range of  indigenous built environments but the influx of white immigrants, from 1652  onwards, also ensured that many of the styles emerging in Europe,  America  and Asia during the nineteenth and twentieth  centuries found reflection in local buildings. In spite of these apparently  disparate roots however, South African architecture has, nonetheless, achieved  a wider homogeneity, being united by a common concern towards climate and  materials, and an ability, on the part of local builders, to adapt, adopt and  reinterpret the building forms and textures of other cultures. In the process  they have also given them new meaning in terms of local values and building  customs. This has given rise to numerous cases of cross-cultural pollination.  The trims of Victorian colonial buildings, for example, have been reinterpreted  by local artists and incorporated into their traditional decorative patterns;  the rural use of exterior space has influenced the growth of an urban verandah,  porch and patio tradition; and the European medieval &quot;longhouse&quot;,  imported to the Cape by early white settlers, adapted to local conditions and  spread throughout the region to become a house form common to black and white  farmers alike.</p>
    <p>This paper seeks to formulate a series of simple definitions of a  number of architectural traditions as they found expression in southern Africa. However it should be borne in mind that  descriptions of &quot;style&quot; are always problematic as they tend, by their  very nature, to generalise and create stereotypical images. Therefore the  interested reader wishing to pursue this study to greater depth is addressed to  the relevant literature on the subject.</p>
    <h5>BHACA</h5>
    <p>A Nguni-speaking group originating from the Mount Frere  district of the Transkei.  The people are more correctly known as the amaBhaca.</p>
    <h5>BOMVANA</h5>
    <p>A Nguni-speaking group originating from the Elliotdale district of  the Transkei.  The people are more correctly known as the amaBomvana.</p>
    <h5>CAPE COTTAGE ARCHITECTURE</h5>
    <p>The Cape cottage is a domestic  form derived from the European medieval &quot;longhouse&quot; tradition,  prevalent in countries surrounding the North Sea,  and introduced into southern Africa by early  white settlers to the Cape. It usually  consisted of a two-cell unit, one being used as a family bedroom, whilst the  second functioned as a cooking and multi-purpose space. The roof was thatched  and usually followed a ridged and hipped form, but it could also be ridged and  gabled. The Cape cottage may be seen as a  forerunner to both Cape   Dutch architecture as  well as the more humble flat roofed house of the southern African interior.</p>
    <h5>CAPE DUTCH ARCHITECTURE</h5>
    <p>A regional style of domestic architecture evolved in the Cape Colony  by Dutch, Flemish and Huguenot settlers during the seventeenth, eighteenth and  early nineteenth centuries. It was based upon a short span gabled roof and  symmetrical plans, usually with an I, T, H or U configuration.  Farmhouses were largely single storied with thick lime-washed walls and  relatively narrow and well-disposed door and window openings. Roofs were  thatched with local reed and terminated by characteristic gables, the latter  undergoing, over the years, a number of stylistic changes. Town houses could  reach two storeys in height and, after the 1750s, were invariably flat-roofed.</p>
    <h5>CAPE DUTCH REVIVALISM</h5>
    <p>Began in southern Africa during  the late 1890s and lasted through until the early 1930s. The architecture of  this period is marked by the reintroduction of such elements as small-paned  timber sash windows and, more generally, the poor re-interpretation of the  earlier gable tradition. Perhaps the most prominent of its proponents was  Herbert Baker who, following his arrival at the Cape  in 1892, began to use the buildings of early Dutch settlers as inspiration for  many of his designs.</p>
    <h5>CAST IRON  ARCHITECTURE</h5>
    <p>Cast iron is a term generally applied to pig-iron which has been  re-melted in a crucible, or furnace, and cast into moulds. It began to find  architectural applications in Europe from 1815  onwards and reached the Cape as early as 1820.  During the Victorian era it was most commonly used in such elements as decorative  trims and motiefs, windows, balcony pieces and street lamps, although its  strength under compression made it pre-eminently suitable for columns and  structural supports. It also found use in the field of prefabricated building  where structures framed in cast iron members and clad with corrugated iron  sheeting were exported by Britain  to its colonial markets.</p>
    <h5>CORBELLED  STONE ARCHITECTURE</h5>
    <p>A type of stone shelter found predominantly on the southern  highveld and parts of Lesotho before 1822 when its construction appears to have  come to an end, probably as a result of the Difaqane. The relatively small size  of such dwellings indicates that they could have been built to house herd-boys  and their activities. Larger corbelled stone structures were also used as lime  kilns in parts of the eastern and western Cape  by early white settlers.</p>
    <h5>CORRUGATED  ARCHITECTURE</h5>
    <p>Derisory term applied during the colonial era to timber framed  dwellings clad in corrugated iron sheeting. It was also sometimes referred to  as Ironic Architecture. This material was introduced in England during  the late 1830s in the form of cast sheets and reached this country in the mid  or late 1840s. Its relatively light weight made it an ideal material for the  production and export of pre-fabricated housing to the colonial markets of India, Australia and South Africa.</p>
    <h5>EDWARDIAN  ARCHITECTURE</h5>
    <p>Although a large measure of overlap may be perceived to have  occurred between Victorian Eclecticism and the Edwardian era, the latter period  was generally marked by a simplification of building styles and of applied  decoration. Structures conformed to neo-classical principles using such  elements as roof parapets, pedimented windows and imposing porticos supported  by classical columns. In domestic architecture sash windows were replaced by  casement openings, verandahs became simpler and greater use was made of plaster  work, pargeting and mouldings.</p>
    <h5>ENGLISH  SETTLER ARCHITECTURE</h5>
    <p>A modified English vernacular tradition brought by British  settlers to the eastern Cape  region after the 1820s. Farm buildings were generally single storied but town  houses often reached two floors. Walls were thick and built in stone and the  ridged roof, thatched or tiled, was terminated at either end by simple linear  parapet gables. In many instances fireplaces were located at either end of the  building and the resultant chimney flue projecting through the gable apex gave  it its characteristic square capping. Subsequently, when buildings began to be  erected with only one fireplace, placed either centrally or at one end of the  dwelling, the square capped gable was often retained as a stylistic feature.</p>
    <h5>FORTIFIED  FARMHOUSE ARCHITECTURE</h5>
    <p>Generally comprised of a single-storey dwelling flanked on either  side by two fort-like towers. Although the first such structures were recorded  in the Outeniquas by Henry Lichtenstein as early as 1803, they only became  widespread on the eastern Cape  frontier region following the border conflict of 1835.</p>
    <h5>GEORGIAN  ARCHITECTURE</h5>
    <p>A style of construction imported to the Cape  by colonial administrators after the British annexation of the Colony from the  Dutch in 1806. Based upon a Palladian interpretation of classical principles  popular in England  at that time, its careful proportioning, dignity of form and elegant interiors  struck a responsive chord in Cape society  whose distance from Europe made the  importation of luxuries prohibitively expensive. It was typified by a plain  facade treatment, parapeted roof lines, regular fenestration and, apart from an  elaboration of the main entrance, a virtual absence of applied decoration.</p>
    <h5>GRIQUA  HOUSE</h5>
    <p>Stereotypical noun applied to a form of dwelling built by Griqua  Khoikhoi immigrants into Griqualand East. It was based upon the Cape cottage built by Dutch colonists and consisted of a  single, rectangular cell approached through a raised stoep at the front, with a  large, open fireplace and massive external chimney stack at one end. Built in  stone with a thatch roof it normally had no windows. The same group of people  are known to have built similar structures but with flat roofs at their former  homesteads in the northern Cape.</p>
    <h5>HARDBIESHUIS</h5>
    <p>(pl. -e). From the Dutch, literally meaning &quot;house made from  hard reeds&quot;. A dwelling form built in southern Africa  up to the turn of the twentieth century by both white settlers and indigenous  residents. It consisted of a series of modified A-frame trusses placed on the  ground and thatched over with reeds. See also kapsteylhuis.</p>
    <h5>HIGHVELD  DWELLING</h5>
    <p>Rectangular plan structure, usually a single cell covered by a  lean-to roof falling to the rear of the building from a raised parapet facade.  Historically this domestic form originated in Cape Town during the latter half of the  eighteenth century where it subsequently also became associated with Malay or  slave dwellings. Its form and constructional technology made it a highly  efficient residential form in warm, dry climates such as that of the Karoo where it flourished during the nineteenth century.  It became associated with the Trekboer culture of that era and was  transplanted to the highveld by Dutch farmers emigrating there after 1836.  During that time it also became associated with the Griquas of the northern Cape. The  introduction of corrugated iron in the southern African interior after the  1860's assisted in its spread and after the Anglo-Boer conflict of 1899-1902 it  became associated with Afrikaner rural culture. During the 1940s it began to be  adopted by black farmers on the highveld where it predominates to the present  day. In more recent times however, it has also become associated with urban  squatter camps such as those found at Thaba 'Nchu in the OFS and Winterveld  near Pretoria.</p>
    <h5>IRONIC  ARCHITECTURE</h5>
    <p>Derisory  term applied during the colonial era to timber framed dwellings clad in  corrugated iron sheeting. See also under &quot;Corrugated Architecture&quot;.</p>
    <h5>KAKEBEENWA</h5>
    <p>(Dutch kakebeen, meaning &quot;jawbone&quot;, and wa  meaning &quot;wagon&quot;). This name is believed to have originated during the  nineteenth century from Dutch farm children who, at one time, used to fashion  toy wagons from animal jawbones. More commonly called an &quot;oxwagon&quot; or  a &quot;voortrekker wagon&quot;, it originated from Sweden, Esthonia, parts of Germany, Holland, Poland  and Rumania  and was used by Dutch migrant farmers of the Cape  interior. Although intended primarily as a means of transport, it also became  adapted by the trekboers as a highly specialised form of travelling  dwelling. Instances of such wagons being converted to more sedentary  residential functions have also been recorded. Ultimately it gained political  symbolism, becoming associated with the growth of Dutch Republics  in the southern African interior.</p>
    <h5>KAPSTEYLHUIS</h5>
    <p>(pl. -e). From the Dutch, literally meaning &quot;house of steep  trusses&quot;. A dwelling form built in southern Africa  up to the turn of the twentieth century by both white settlers and indigenous  inhabitants. It consisted of a series of A-frame trusses placed on the ground  and thatched over with reeds. Structures of a similar form but roofed over with  corrugated iron have also been recorded more recently in parts of the northern Cape and Lesotho. See  also Hardbieshuis.</p>
    <h5>KAROO HOUSE</h5>
    <p>See under  &quot;Highveld Dwelling&quot;.</p>
    <h5>KHOIKHOI  ARCHITECTURE.</h5>
    <p>The Khoikhoi were migrant pastoralists who, before the arrival of  white settlers to southern Africa, inhabited  the Cape, Orange Free State and southern Botswana. The  term is thought to mean, quite literally, &quot;men of men&quot;. In keeping  with their economic system their dwellings were easily dismountable and  transportable, consisting of a hemispherical framework of saplings overlaid by  reed matting or animal skins. Such structures were also known to the Dutch  settlers as maanjiehuise, believed to mean &quot;small, moon  houses&quot;. The Khoikhoi, together with the San, are also known to have used  another form of transportable housing, consisting of a reed mat arched into a  barrel vault pegged at either end, with a second mat being placed upright in a  semi-circle behind it, thus creating a wind break.</p>
    <h5>LOBEDU</h5>
    <p>Indigenous southern African group inhabiting a region of the  northern Transvaal immediately south of Venda. The  people are more correctly known as the vaLobedu.</p>
    <h5>MATABELE</h5>
    <p>Shona adaptation of the noun amaNdebele. This was the name  given by the Sotho/Tswana to the Nguni group who, under the leadership of  Mzilikazi, moved out of northern Zululand in  1822 and eventually settled down in western Zimbabwe in 1837. The word stems  from the Tswana root tebele meaning &quot;plunderer&quot; or  &quot;stranger&quot;. The Matabele should not be mistaken with the Ndebele  groups of the Transvaal.</p>
    <h5>MAT  SHELTERS</h5>
    <p>Temporary shelters used by KhoiSan migrant pastoralists and hunter  gatherers in the central Cape region. They  consisted of a grass mat arched into a barrel vault and pegged down at either  end by two sticks. A second mat was placed upright in a semi-circle behind the  mat vault, thus creating a wind break. Under certain circumstances either mat  could be used independently of the other to provide an overnight shelter for  travellers.</p>
    <h5>MFENGU</h5>
    <p>Collective name for the Nguni-speaking groups, mostly originating from  the Zululand area, who fled into the southern Transkei and Ciskei regions  between 1822 and 1837. The name, meaning &quot;beggars&quot; or, perhaps more  kindly, &quot;homeless wanderers&quot;, was applied to them by the Xhosa upon  whose lands they eventually settled. They are also more popularly known as the Fingos,  this being an anglicisation of the noun amaMfengu.</p>
    <h5>MPONDO</h5>
    <p>Nguni-speaking group originating from the coastal region of the  north-eastern Transkei.  They are more correctly known as the amaMpondo but have also been known  to white settlers as the Pondos.</p>
    <h5>MPONDOMISE</h5>
    <p>Nguni-speaking group inhabiting the Qumbu district of central Transkei. They  are more correctly known as the amaMpondomise.</p>
    <h5>NDEBELE</h5>
    <p>Sotho/Tswana noun which has been applied in various contexts to indigenous  groups who have either settled on or moved through the highveld region of  southern Africa. Its roots have been  attributed to the Tswana noun tebele meaning &quot;plunderer&quot;. At  one time it was believed to have been an appellation created by the Sotho/Tswana  as a general term for the Nguni but more recent research has shown that its use  has also been made in a Sotho/Tswana context. Various groups are known, both  currently and in the past, to have used this noun or its derivatives. This  includes the Matabele of western Zimbabwe, the South Ndebele of the  south and eastern Transvaal, the North Ndebele  of the central Transvaal and the Hlubi clan of  the Tlokwa, living in the Nqutu district of KwaZulu. Their language is referred  to as isiNdebele.</p>
    <h5>PEDI  ARCHITECTURE</h5>
    <p>The Pedi are a Sotho/Tswana speaking group inhabiting the  Sekhukhuneland region of the central and northern Transvaal.  Their architecture resembled closely that of their Tswana neighbours and  consisted largely of a circular plan cone on cylinder surrounded about its  perimeter by a wide verandah. See also &quot;Tswana Architecture&quot;. Their  settlements followed a characteristic circular fan shape with a central cattle  byre, which also served as a meeting place for the men as well as an area of  burial and religious worship.</p>
    <h5>PREFABRICATED  ARCHITECTURE</h5>
    <p>The concept of prefabricating buildings within a factory  environment appears to have begun in Britain during the early years of  the nineteenth century when colonial expansion created a ready market for high  quality transportable housing. Although these structures were initially in  timber, the subsequent introduction of industrialised building elements such as  corrugated sheeting and cast iron served to enlarge and enrich the range of  textures and forms possible under such a system of construction.</p>
    <h5>SAN  ARCHITECTURE</h5>
    <p>The San were an indigenous group of migrant hunter-gatherers who  inhabited the southern African region up to the early part of the nineteenth  century. Their name is drawn from the Khoikhoi and is believed to signify  &quot;a person without domestic stock&quot;. Their architecture was largely  pre-determined by the migrant nature of their society and included rock caves  and overhangs, temporary shelters made out of branches and clumps of  vegetation, as well as more formal mat screens and shelters such as those also  used by Khoikhoi migrant pastoralists of the central Cape region. These  consisted of a grass mat arched into a barrel vault and pegged down at either  end by two sticks. A second mat was placed upright in a semi-circle behind the  mat vault, thus creating a wind break. Under certain circumstances either mat  could be used independently of the other to provide an overnight shelter for  travellers. Cases of San building a type of Khoi mat beehive hut were also recorded  by travelers during the early part of the nineteenth century.</p>
    <h5>SHONA</h5>
    <p>A group of people indigenous to Zimbabwe, although in the past  their lands are thought to have included large areas of the northern Transvaal. They are more correctly known as the maShona  and their language is referred to as chiShona. The Venda are also  currently believed to be part of a larger Shona grouping.</p>
    <h5>SOTHO  ARCHITECTURE</h5>
    <p>The Sotho are a group indigenous to the interior of Southern Africa who today inhabit the Lesotho and southern  highveld region. Their architecture has undergone extensive changes in recent  years. At one time this area was noted for its grass beehive dwellings with  extended, snout-like entrances but since the 1920s it has undergone widespread  change and today the thatched cone on cylinder and the lean-to highveld house  rival each other for pre-eminence. The latter dwellings often display richly  decorated facades.</p>
    <h5>SOUTH  NDEBELE ARCHITECTURE</h5>
    <p>The South Ndebele inhabit a region of the Transvaal  located north-east of Pretoria,  between Middelburg and Groblersdal. Historically their architecture has been  based upon that of their northern neighbours and political allies, the Pedi.  Their dwellings were circular with a verandah running about the external  perimeter but in recent years these have largely been superseded by square  plan, lean-to, parapet structures, much like those found on the southern  highveld. Since the 1940s their women have developed a distinctive style of  polychromatic wall art which draws deeply from the patterns of urban life they  have observed in the towns about them.</p>
    <h5>STICK  STYLE</h5>
    <p>A style of domestic timber construction prevalent in the United States  during the latter part of the nineteenth century. Its aesthetic is roughly  comparable to that of Late Victorian Eclecticism. (Afrikaans: Amerikaanse Lat).</p>
    <h5>STILT  ARCHITECTURE</h5>
    <p>Although stilt structures have been built in the past by many of  southern Africa's rural groups, most have  functioned as either grain stores and chicken coops or, in some instances, as  weapon stores. The only exceptions to this rule were recorded in the 1830s by  travellers to the western Transvaal and  eastern Botswana  region where grass huts were placed either upon a stilt platform or within the  branches of a tree.</p>
    <h5>SWAZI  ARCHITECTURE</h5>
    <p>The Swazi are a Nguni-speaking group inhabiting the north-eastern  part of the southern African region, also known as the Kingdom of Swaziland.  They are more correctly known as the amaSwazi and their language is  referred to as isiSwati. Their architectural traditions are similar to  those of their Zulu neighbours in the south, and make extensive use of the  grass covered beehive form. In more recent times however these have begun to  give way to cone on cylinder dwellings.</p>
    <h5>TEMPORARY  SHELTERS</h5>
    <p>May have been erected for a variety of reasons such as providing  overnight shelter to travellers or to house a dying person's final hours.</p>
    <h5>THEMBU</h5>
    <p>Nguni-speaking  group residing in the central region of the Transkei. The people are more  correctly known as the abaThembu.</p>
    <h5>TREKBOER  ARCHITECTURE</h5>
    <p>The name of trekboer was given to migrant Dutch  pastoralists who, during the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, settled  in the more arid regions of the Cape. Their  architecture tended to be functional and was largely related to their migrant  pastoralist lifestyle. As a result they used a variety of domestic forms  including their oxwagons, Khoi-like mat beehive huts, Cape  cottages, hardbieshuise, kapsteylhuise and flat roofed houses.  Such structures were invariably poorly built and were seldom designed to meet  long term economic needs or high social expectations.</p>
    <h5>TSONGA  ARCHITECTURE</h5>
    <p>The Tsonga are an indigenous group inhabiting the eastern littoral  belt of southern Africa from Kosi Bay  in the south to Sofala in Mocambique. As a result of the Difaqane some groups  moved westwards and settled in an area immediately south of Venda which is  today known as Gazankulu. The people are more correctly known as the vaTsonga  and their language is referred to as siTsonga. Their architecture makes  predominant use of circular, cone on cylinder dwellings surrounded by wide  verandahs with low sweeping eaves and sturdy supporting pillars. In more recent  times their women have also begun to decorate their homestead walls with bold  polychromatic designs.</p>
    <h5>TSWANA  ARCHITECTURE</h5>
    <p>The Tswana are indigenous to the interior of southern Africa and belong to a larger Sotho/Tswana grouping.  Although they originally populated much of the highveld region, the events of  the Difaqane forced many of them to move westwards. Today they inhabit Botswana, parts  of the western Transvaal, the northern Cape as well as  a small enclave in the Thaba 'Nchu district of the Orange Free State. The Tswana are best known  for their use of circular plan, cone on cylinder dwellings surrounded about  their perimeter by a wide verandah. This form is known to have been built by  them in the western Transvaal, northern Cape and  eastern Botswana  region since the 1600s and probably earlier. Although most such structures  today comprise a single living cell, in the past they are known to have reached  a high degree of sophistication, including in their plan a number of sleeping  and storage areas. Settlement is generally made according to clan affiliations,  but the scarcity of water in the region has led to the growth of large urban  centres which, in the past, have been estimated to have achieved populations of  between 10,000 and 20,000 persons.</p>
    <h5>VENDA ARCHITECTURE</h5>
    <p>The Venda  are an indigenous group inhabiting the northern Transvaal  in an area bordering with eastern Zimbabwe. Their domestic  architecture is perhaps best noted for its broad eaves, often supported by  verandah posts running the full perimeter of a cone on cylinder dwelling, and  the use of stone in the construction of fortified villages for local chiefs and  headmen. Wall decorations painted by women feature strongly on the perimeter  walls of their homesteads which differ markedly from the circular pattern  predominant throughout the rest of southern Africa.</p>
    <h5>VERANDAH  DWELLINGS</h5>
    <p>Generic term used to describe any dwelling with an attached  verandah. This may be a partial verandah, covering one or more facades of a  building, or a full verandah, as in the case of the cone on cylinder, where it  runs the full perimeter of the structure. Although the verandah dwelling is  indigenous to many parts of the southern African interior, its use as a  colonial building can probably be attributed to its introduction into Natal from India during  the nineteenth century.</p>
    <h5>VICTORIAN  ARCHITECTURE</h5>
    <p>Although the Victorian era was typified by an exuberant and richly  textured architecture, much of this character relied upon the use of applied  decoration. At first it largely took the form of fretted timber work, used in  verandah trims, barge boards, gable finials and loft ventilators but the  subsequent availability of mass produced cast iron work also gave added  richness to roof lines and verandahs. Although there was an initial tendency to  &quot;modernise&quot; previous Cape   Dutch and Georgian  dwellings by the addition of front and rear verandahs, a wide range of domestic  and public buildings were also erected. Their style is better known for its  eclecticism, including elements freely drawn from such varied sources as  Medieval Gothic, Italian Romanesque and Byzantine traditions. Wide use was also  made of ornamented chimneys, bay windows, sash timber frames, roof-ventilators  and patterned brickwork, particularly after the 1870s and the discovery of  diamonds and gold deposits in the southern African interior.</p>
    <h5>XESIBE</h5>
    <p>Nguni-speaking  group originating from the northern Transkei. The people are more  correctly known as the amaXesibe.</p>
    <h5>XHOSA  ARCHITECTURE</h5>
    <p>The Xhosa are a Nguni-speaking group originating from the southern  Transkei,  Ciskei  and eastern Cape  region. Although the Xhosa-speaking groups of southern Africa  cannot by any means be considered as a single entity, their architectural  culture has achieved a large degree of homogeneity. At one time most, if not  all, are thought to have built hemispherical grass beehive dwellings but, since  the early 1900s, these have been replaced with circular plan cone on cylinder  structures. Barring a few regional variations in building methods and material  textures, these present a uniform architectural style for the region. This has  increased since the mid-1920s when local women began to whitewash monochromatic  patterns upon their residence facades, leading to some chroniclers making  reference to them as being &quot;white faced&quot;.</p>
    <h5>ZULU  ARCHITECTURE</h5>
    <p>The Zulu were originally a small Nguni-speaking group numbering  about 2000 persons inhabiting the region of northern Zululand  between the upper Mhlatuzi and the White   Mfolozi Rivers.  They rose to political dominance under the leadership of Shaka between 1816 and  1819. Ultimately the Zulu kingdom spread along the eastern littoral from the  Pongola in the north to the Tukela in the south. The word amaZulu  literally means &quot;children of the sky&quot;. Their architecture was marked,  up to recent times, for its wide use of grass-thatched domed dwellings sited in  wide circular settlements about a central cattle byre. This popular stereotype  however has undergone extensive revision since the 1950s when the ubiquitous  cone on cylinder began to replace the more picturesque but less efficient domed  structures.</p>
