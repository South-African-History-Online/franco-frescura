    <h5>MONUMENTS OR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT</h5>
    <p>Franco Frescura</p>
    <p>The  proponents of historical conservation in South Africa were probably inspired  by romantic ideals similar to those expressed by Italo Calvino, when he wrote  that &quot;a town without old buildings is like a man without a memory&quot;.  As a result to date some 3828 of this country's buildings, sites and artifacts  have been declared national monuments. 97% of these celebrate white culture,  83% are located in urban areas, and 75% may be found in the Cape.  One outcome of this bias has been to reinforce some black preconceptions: that  whites are overly pre-occupied with the conservation of old books, buildings  and artifacts whilst having a throw-away attitude towards their parents,  marriages and children.</p>
    <p>The  declaration of monuments has also had some unexpected and unwanted  repercussions at a material level. Buildings singled out for national status  are automatically elevated to the position of &quot;cultural objects&quot;,  and are thus separated from their urban contexts. Surrounding buildings not  accorded such recognition are somehow deemed to be &quot;less worthy&quot;  and therefore become more vulnerable to demolition and redevelopment. The  proclamation of a monument, therefore, has often led to the destruction of its  immediate surrounds. Cuthbert's Building, in Johannesburg, stands testimony to such  failure.</p>
    <p>Debates  currently taking place in South    Africa indicate that present national  monument policies will have to undergo a dramatic reorientation of emphasis if  our historical built heritage is to survive. In part this will mean replacing  the Monument Council's predominant white, male and conservative terms of  reference with ones more reflective of this country's rich and varied cultural  fabric. Since 1936 the Council has been served by 86 executive members. To date  only three have been women, two have come from outside the white community, and  at least 30 are known to be Broederbonders.</p>
    <p>It  also means that conservation efforts will not be focused entirely upon  individual historical buildings, or even groups of structures, but upon whole  environments. Special attention will have to be paid to preserving a  community's quality of life, and the financial opportunities that such  environments can engender. South    Africa cannot afford monuments whose only  function is to house museums, nor can it allow the values of our ancestors to  dictate the lives of the living. New and appropriate uses will have to be found  for old buildings, and new ways of preserving the ephemeral will need to be  explored.</p>
    <p>The  objective of such moves would not be to freeze growth, as many people fear, but  rather to permit development and work-generation within the framework of a  valuable and non-renewable resource. The commercial viability and tourist value  of historical environments has been more than demonstrated at the Waterfront in  Cape Town, and  the city centres of Pietermaritzburg and Stellenbosch. Even Johannesburg  which, over the years, has imploded its historical heritage as part of a  sustained programme of Sunday entertainment, revels in the prepackaged  historical confections of Gold   Reef City.  Tourists also clearly prefer the charms of Fransch Hoek, to those of Vanderbijl Park, and successful business people are  retiring to historical Montagu, not Welkom.</p>
    <p>The conservation  of whole environments will also make it possible to preserve some of this  country's indigenous architecture. Important settlements may be found at  kwaMatabeleng near Pretoria, Mukumbani in Venda, and Mapungubwe near Messina, which dates back 1050 AD and is  presently the site of an SADF army camp. A new attitude towards monuments also  means that the status of some structures will have to change.&nbsp; I do not believe that too many tears will be  shed when Verwoerd's cottage at Betty's Bay is deproclaimed. A radical change  of image will also be needed in the case of Uitenhage's prime civic landmark,  the Victoria Tower, which once housed the Security  Police HQ.</p>
    <p>Distinction  will also have to be drawn between &quot;monuments&quot;, buildings  which belong to the national heritage, and &quot;memorials&quot;, which  are normally structures of little architectural merit. Post-colonial Africa has  an excellent record of maintaining both, and South Africa will probably not  prove the exception. However, I foresee that a strong case may well be made at  some future time for the privatisation of the Voortrekker  Monument, and personally I think that  a valuable piece of real estate such as Strydom Square, in Pretoria, will not remain a jacuzzi for  horses for very long.</p>
    <p>One  major change, however, is likely to be the devolution of the conservation  process into local and regional structures. Local communities are best  qualified to judge the memories they hold dearest and wish to hand down to  future generations. This means that, while a central agency (like the NMC) will  continue to take responsibility for the national heritage, local historical  societies, museums and interest groups will be able to identify and preserve  structures of regional value.</p>
    <p>It is  clear from negotiations, however, that a large body of consensus already exists  upon many of these points. The need to preserve our historical environment is  no longer a matter of cultural romanticism, but is likely to form a major  component of this country's future economic development.</p>
